    "text": "ABP101Y1 2024-2025\nMolecular Biology Lab 1: DNA Isolation and Gel Electrophoresis lab report\nIntroduction\nIn my investigation, I set out to see how different protocols (basic vs refined) can affect the \nquality of DNA isolated from wheat germ. My primary focus was comparing the refined \nprotocol that incorporates Protein Precipitation Solution (PPS) against the basic method. I \nhypothesized that the additional protein removal step in the refined protocol would yield \npurer DNA samples with more distinct gel electrophoresis bands and reduced protein \ncontamination. Methods and Materials\nI performed DNA extraction from wheat germ samples using two distinct protocols:\n1. A basic protocol following standard DNA extraction procedures\n2. A refined protocol incorporating an additional protein precipitation step\nBoth samples underwent gel electrophoresis to evaluate DNA quality and purity. I then \nanalyzed the resulting bands under UV transillumination to see the success of my \nextractions. Results\nThe gel electrophoresis results provided evidence of the differences between the two \nprotocols. We can clearly see that the refined one produced notably sharper and more \ncompact DNA bands, suggesting higher purity levels. In contrast, the DNA bands from the \nbasic protocol appeared somewhat broader and showed slight smearing, likely showing \nthe presence of protein contamination or other impurities. The results supported our initial \nhypothesis. The refined protocol, with its additional protein precipitation step, proved more \neffective at producing high-quality DNA samples. Watching the presence of visible, \ncolorless DNA pellets after centrifugation served as our first indicator of successful \nextraction. The gel electrophoresis results further confirmed this success, with the DNA \nbands fluorescing clearly under UV light. I also noticed identified some critical factors that impact DNA extraction quality like how \nprecise pipetting technique can prove crucial for maintaining accurate reagent ratios and \nhow proper centrifugation parameters ensure optimal separation of DNA from \ncontaminants. Conclusion\nThe investigation clearly demonstrated the superior effectiveness of the refined protocol \nfor DNA extraction. While both methods successfully extracted DNA, the refined protocol's \nadditional protein precipitation step resulted in notably purer samples, evident in the \nsharper, more distinct gel bands.",
