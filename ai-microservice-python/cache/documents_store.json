Article 2.-  Principle of Legality. (1) Criminal law specifies the various crimes, and the penalties and \nmeasures applicable to criminals. (2) The Court may not treat as a crime and punish any act or omission \nwhich is not prohibited by law. The Court may not impose penalties or measures other than those \nprescribed by law. (3) The Court may not create crimes by analogy. (4) The above provisions shall not prevent the Court from interpreting the \nlaw. In cases of doubt the Court shall interpret the law according to its \nspirit, in accordance with the meaning intended by the legislature so as \nto achieve the purpose it has in view. 2\n(5) Nobody shall be tried or punished again for the same crime for which \nhe has been already convicted, punished or subjected to other \nmeasures or acquitted by a final decision in accordance with the law. Article 3.- Other Penal  Legislation. Nothing in this Code shall affect regulations and special laws of a criminal  \nnature: \n        Provided that the general principles embodied in this Code are \napplicable to those regulations and laws except as otherwise expressly \nprovided therein.

(1) In all cases where the commission of a crime requires the achievement \nof a given result, the crime shall not be deemed to have been \ncommitted unless the result achieved is the consequence of the act or \nomission with which the accused person is charged. This relationship of cause and effect shall be presumed to exist \nwhen the act within the provisions of the law would, in the normal \ncourse of things, produce the result charged.

(1) Whoever intentionally begins to commit a crime and does not pursue \nor is unable to pursue his criminal activity to its end, or who pursues \nhis criminal activity to its end without achieving the result necessary for \nthe completion of the crime shall be guilty of an attempt. The crime is deemed to be begun when the act performed clearly \naims, by way of direct consequence, at its commission. (2) An attempted crime is always punishable save as is otherwise \nprovided by law. A mere attempt to instigate or assist in a crime does not come \nwithin the provisions of the law unless it is expressly provided to the \ncontrary. 12\n(3) Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 117, in the case of an \nattempted crime the criminal is liable to the punishment attaching to \nthe crime he intended to commit: \n       Provided that if circumstances so justify the Court may reduce the \npunishment within the limits provided by law (Art. 179).

Section II. - Suspension of Penalty \n \n     Sub-section I.-    Conditional Suspension of Penalty \n \nArticle 190.-  \nPrinciple. When the Court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, \nconsiders that conditional suspension of the penalty will promote the \nreform and reinstatement of the criminal, it may order conditional \nsuspension of the sentence as provided hereinafter. 75\nSuch an order implies an appeal to the cooperation of the criminal for \nhis own reform and may at any time be revoked if circumstances show \nthat it is not justified. Article 191.-  \nSuspension of Pronouncement of the Penalty;    \nSuspended Sentence. When the criminal has no previous conviction and does not appear \ndangerous and where his crime is punishable with fine (Art. 90), \ncompulsory labour (Arts. 103 and 104) or simple imprisonment for not \nmore than three years (Art. 106), the Court, after having convicted the \ncriminal, may suspend sentence and place the criminal on probation, \nwhere it is of the opinion that such decision will lead to the reform of the \ncriminal. No conviction shall be entered when a criminal is placed on probation and \ndoes not break the conditions of his probation. Article 192.-  \nSuspension of Enforcement of the Penalty. When the Court considers that the criminal, whether previously sentenced \nor not (Art.194), shall receive a warning it shall enter a conviction and \npass sentence but may order that the enforcement of the sentence be \nsuspended for a specified period of probation. The Court may not, \nhowever, suspend the enforcement of measures (Arts. 127-159). If the probation is successfully undergone the sentence shall be \nremitted, but the conviction entered in the Judgment register shall remain \nwith all its other consequences. Article 193.-  \nCumulation of Penalties, Divisibility of Suspension. If there is a cumulation of penalties, in particular when secondary \npenalties are imposed, the Court may, for public securities or general \ninterest, decide not to extend the measure of suspension to some of the \npenalties on account of their preventive nature and the interest attaching \nto their enforcement.

During this period, radical political, economic and social \nchanges have taken place in Ethiopia. Among  the major changes are  \nthe recognition by the Constitution and international agreements \nratified by Ethiopia of the equality between religions, nations, \nnationalities and peoples,  the democratic rights and freedoms of \ncitizens and residents,  human rights, and most of all, the rights of \nsocial groups like women and children. After all these phenomena \nhave taken place,  it would be  inappropriate to allow the continuance \nof the enforcement of the 1949 Penal Code. Another discernible gap in the Penal Code is its failure to  \nproperly address crimes born of advances in technology and the \ncomplexities of modern life. The Penal Code does not incorporate \ncrimes such as the hijacking of aircraft, computer crimes and money \nlaundering. Besides, as regards crimes related to corruption and drugs \nalthough they are nowadays, attracting attention both in legislation \nand follow-up not only within national frontiers but also on the regional \nand international levels, due to the grave crises they are causing, the \nPenal code does not adequately deal with such crimes with the degree \nof seriousness they deserve. Another point that should not be overlooked is the Penal Code's \nfailure to acknowledge the grave injuries and sufferings caused to \nwomen and children by reason of harmful traditional practices. Surely, \nthe Constitution guarantees respect for the cultures of peoples, but it \ndoes not buttress up those practices scientifically proven to be \nharmful. It is also futile to issue a law that does not have the trust \nand support of the people for it usually remains impracticable.",

    "text": "But it \nis well recognized in the philosophy of criminal legislation that the \nlegislature should, by adopting progressive laws at times, educate and \nguide the public to dissociate  itself from harmful traditional practices. 328\nFurthermore, it is desirable to adopt a comprehensive code by \nassembling the various criminal provisions published in the Negarit \nGazeta in a disintegrated manner. Similarly, since the parallel \napplication, of the regular Penal Code and the Revised Special Penal \nCode in respect of similar matters disregards equality among citizens, \nthe existence of a comprehensive Criminal Code will put an end to \nsuch practice. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings and \nadopt a comprehensive Criminal Code, substantial activities have been \nundertaken throughout the entire Country. Discussions have been \nheld on the draft Criminal Code  prepared by the Ministry of Justice \nand the Justice and Legal System Research Institute. Legal and \nmedical professionals, psychiatrists, different institutions of higher \neducation and professional associations have made significant \ncontributions through the opinions they gave to the enactment of the \nlaw. Representatives of the people selected from different sectors and \nassociations have forwarded important views in discussion forums on \nthe draft laws conducted in Addis Ababa and the regions. It is mainly \non the basis of public opinion that punishments have increased in \nrespect of crimes like rape and aggravated theft. Moreover, the \nopinions of legal scholars and the laws and experiences of foreign \ncountries have been consulted to enrich the content of the Criminal \nCode. Finally, one point that must not be left unmentioned is the \nmatter concerning the determination of sentence. Since it is essential \nto facilitate the method by which Courts can pass similar punishments  \non similar cases, some major changes have been made in the \nprovisions of the Code. Provisions of the Penal Code that used to \nmake sentencing complicated and difficult have been amended. Provisions have been inserted which enable the Courts to pass the \nappropriate penalty for each case by carefully examining from the \nlightest to the most severe punishment. A sentencing manual will also \nbe issued to ensure and control the correctness and uniformity of \nsentencing. Another point which must be raised in connection with the  \ndetermination of sentence is that the purpose of Criminal Law is  to \npreserve the peace and security of society. It protects society by \npreventing the commission of crimes, and a major means of \npreventing the commission of crime is punishment.",

    "text": "Punishment can\n329\ndeter wrongdoers from committing  other crimes;  it can also serve as \na warning to prospective wrongdoers. Although imprisonment and \ndeath are enforced in respect of certain crimes the main objective is  \ntemporarily or permanently to prevent wrongdoers from committing \nfurther crimes against society. And in such cases with the exception \nof the death sentence even criminals sentenced to life imprisonment \ncan be released on parole before serving the whole term;  in certain \ncrimes \nconvicts \ncan \nbe \nreleased \non \nprobation \nwithout \nthe \npronouncement of sentence or without the enforcement of the \nsentence pronounced. This helps wrongdoers to lead a peaceful life \nand it indicates the major place which the Criminal Law has allocated \nfor their rehabilitation. The fact that wrongdoers, instead of being made to suffer while in \nprison, take vocational training and participate in academic education, \nwhich would benefit them upon their release, reaffirms the great \nconcern the Criminal Code has for the reform of criminals. It must be noted that, by laying down in the  Code express provisions \nconcerning these cases, it is intended that Courts should, on passing \nsentence, take into account the purpose of the law and the different \naims of punishment. It is hoped that this Criminal Code, which has been revised through all \nthese persistent efforts, will ensure respect for the order,  peace and \nsecurity of the State and its peoples as well as respect for the rights \nand freedoms of its citizens and inhabitants. Being convinced that this Code will enable to accelerate the economic \nprogress of the State, that it will strengthen a steady order of free \nmarket and that it will, above all, contribute towards the promotion of \na fair judicial system, in our country,  pursuant to Article 55(1) of the \nConstitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia it is hereby \nproclaimed as follows:\n330\n1. Short Title: \nThis Proclamation may be cited as \"The Criminal Code of the \nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia 2004.\" 2.
