It aims at the prevention of crimes by giving due notice of the crimes \nand penalties prescribed by law and should this be ineffective by providing \nfor the punishment of criminals in order to deter them from committing \nanother crime and make them a lesson to others, or by providing for their \nreform and measures to prevent the commission of further crimes. Article 2.-  Principle of Legality. (1) Criminal law specifies the various crimes, and the penalties and \nmeasures applicable to criminals.

During this period, radical political, economic and social \nchanges have taken place in Ethiopia. Among  the major changes are  \nthe recognition by the Constitution and international agreements \nratified by Ethiopia of the equality between religions, nations, \nnationalities and peoples,  the democratic rights and freedoms of \ncitizens and residents,  human rights, and most of all, the rights of \nsocial groups like women and children. After all these phenomena \nhave taken place,  it would be  inappropriate to allow the continuance \nof the enforcement of the 1949 Penal Code. Another discernible gap in the Penal Code is its failure to  \nproperly address crimes born of advances in technology and the \ncomplexities of modern life. The Penal Code does not incorporate \ncrimes such as the hijacking of aircraft, computer crimes and money \nlaundering. Besides, as regards crimes related to corruption and drugs \nalthough they are nowadays, attracting attention both in legislation \nand follow-up not only within national frontiers but also on the regional \nand international levels, due to the grave crises they are causing, the \nPenal code does not adequately deal with such crimes with the degree \nof seriousness they deserve. Another point that should not be overlooked is the Penal Code's \nfailure to acknowledge the grave injuries and sufferings caused to \nwomen and children by reason of harmful traditional practices. Surely, \nthe Constitution guarantees respect for the cultures of peoples, but it \ndoes not buttress up those practices scientifically proven to be \nharmful. It is also futile to issue a law that does not have the trust \nand support of the people for it usually remains impracticable.",

    "text": "But it \nis well recognized in the philosophy of criminal legislation that the \nlegislature should, by adopting progressive laws at times, educate and \nguide the public to dissociate  itself from harmful traditional practices. 328\nFurthermore, it is desirable to adopt a comprehensive code by \nassembling the various criminal provisions published in the Negarit \nGazeta in a disintegrated manner. Similarly, since the parallel \napplication, of the regular Penal Code and the Revised Special Penal \nCode in respect of similar matters disregards equality among citizens, \nthe existence of a comprehensive Criminal Code will put an end to \nsuch practice. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings and \nadopt a comprehensive Criminal Code, substantial activities have been \nundertaken throughout the entire Country. Discussions have been \nheld on the draft Criminal Code  prepared by the Ministry of Justice \nand the Justice and Legal System Research Institute. Legal and \nmedical professionals, psychiatrists, different institutions of higher \neducation and professional associations have made significant \ncontributions through the opinions they gave to the enactment of the \nlaw. Representatives of the people selected from different sectors and \nassociations have forwarded important views in discussion forums on \nthe draft laws conducted in Addis Ababa and the regions. It is mainly \non the basis of public opinion that punishments have increased in \nrespect of crimes like rape and aggravated theft. Moreover, the \nopinions of legal scholars and the laws and experiences of foreign \ncountries have been consulted to enrich the content of the Criminal \nCode. Finally, one point that must not be left unmentioned is the \nmatter concerning the determination of sentence. Since it is essential \nto facilitate the method by which Courts can pass similar punishments  \non similar cases, some major changes have been made in the \nprovisions of the Code. Provisions of the Penal Code that used to \nmake sentencing complicated and difficult have been amended. Provisions have been inserted which enable the Courts to pass the \nappropriate penalty for each case by carefully examining from the \nlightest to the most severe punishment. A sentencing manual will also \nbe issued to ensure and control the correctness and uniformity of \nsentencing. Another point which must be raised in connection with the  \ndetermination of sentence is that the purpose of Criminal Law is  to \npreserve the peace and security of society. It protects society by \npreventing the commission of crimes, and a major means of \npreventing the commission of crime is punishment.",

    "text": "Punishment can\n329\ndeter wrongdoers from committing  other crimes;  it can also serve as \na warning to prospective wrongdoers. Although imprisonment and \ndeath are enforced in respect of certain crimes the main objective is  \ntemporarily or permanently to prevent wrongdoers from committing \nfurther crimes against society. And in such cases with the exception \nof the death sentence even criminals sentenced to life imprisonment \ncan be released on parole before serving the whole term;  in certain \ncrimes \nconvicts \ncan \nbe \nreleased \non \nprobation \nwithout \nthe \npronouncement of sentence or without the enforcement of the \nsentence pronounced. This helps wrongdoers to lead a peaceful life \nand it indicates the major place which the Criminal Law has allocated \nfor their rehabilitation. The fact that wrongdoers, instead of being made to suffer while in \nprison, take vocational training and participate in academic education, \nwhich would benefit them upon their release, reaffirms the great \nconcern the Criminal Code has for the reform of criminals. It must be noted that, by laying down in the  Code express provisions \nconcerning these cases, it is intended that Courts should, on passing \nsentence, take into account the purpose of the law and the different \naims of punishment. It is hoped that this Criminal Code, which has been revised through all \nthese persistent efforts, will ensure respect for the order,  peace and \nsecurity of the State and its peoples as well as respect for the rights \nand freedoms of its citizens and inhabitants. Being convinced that this Code will enable to accelerate the economic \nprogress of the State, that it will strengthen a steady order of free \nmarket and that it will, above all, contribute towards the promotion of \na fair judicial system, in our country,  pursuant to Article 55(1) of the \nConstitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia it is hereby \nproclaimed as follows:\n330\n1.

However, due to time and financial constraints it remained only a vision. Recently the USAID- Feteh (Justice) Activity in Ethiopia, in consultation with\nthe Consortium of Law Schools across Ethiopia, expressed an interest to finance\nthe preparation of law text books among which preparation of textbook on\nemployment law is one. Consequently, it issued an open tender to qualified and\ninterested researchers to take up the task. We felt that an opportune moment has come to convert the idea into reality.",

    "text": "We\nthus decided to grab this golden opportunity and submitted our proposal for\nconsideration by the Project Office. Fortunately, our proposal got acceptance by\nthe Feteh. Incidentally, we would like to appreciate and thank the USAID- Feteh\n(Justice) Activity in Ethiopia for initiating, supervising and financing the\npreparation of this text book. In a country where industrialization is becoming at\nthe top of its economic agenda, materials on industrial relations are pertinent and\ntimely. The material covered in this text is allotted in terms of what should be discussed\nand achieved in a semester of three credit hours. Thus, setting priority for\ncoverage is warranted. Although Ethiopian employment regime has two broad\ncategories (namely; the private sector and the civil service sector employment\nregimes), due to mainly time constraint, it is the former which has been given\nmuch emphasis in course designing and class deliberations in our law schools. This is also the experience I gathered from my course offering on “Employment\nLaw” for almost two decades at the Addis Ababa University-School of Law. The reason for focusing on private sector, other than time constraints is, in the\nEthiopian context, it is the private sector employment regime which mainly\nregulates the profit-making sector that is more controversial and more litigated. Thus, for the benefit of practical importance, the private sector employment\nregime will be the main focus of this text book. The civil service employment\nregime is designed to achieve uniformity in determining rights and obligations\ntogether with conditions of employment of civil servants. Furthermore, the\nix\nPreface\nremuneration of civil servants has financial implications that have to be reflected\nin public budgets, which are approved by such bodies as parliaments and\nmunicipalities. Thus, it prohibits or leaves little room for negotiation; and it is\nmore of an administrative law type rather than contractual engagement. Hence,\nto a certain extent, the civil service employment regime is accommodated under\n“Administrative Law” courses. It does not however mean that the civil service\nemployment regime will be uncharted territory in this text. Infact, for\npurposes of comparison, there may be instances where consulting the Federal\nCivil Servants’ Proclamation may be appropriate. As I said, this text book is a result of accumulated experience and observation in\nteaching and research on the subject for more than two decades.",

    "text": "Since the time\nallocated for the course “Employment Law” is one semester of three credit hours\n(five ECTS) in the national curriculum, provision by provision discussion in the\nform of explanatory note would be unfeasible. Hence, I took the liberty to pick\nand choose the provisions of the law that are frequently “tried and tested” in the\nworld of practice before our courts and labour tribunals. Issues coined and\ndeveloped in long years of class discussions with many of my students have been\nincorporated in the text with a view to provoking further deliberations in future\nclasses with incoming students. It is hoped that this text will offer a modest\ncontribution in harmonizing course delivery in the various law schools across the\ncountry. In terms of structure and organization, this text is organized under eight chapters. Chapter I contains general introductory remarks and offers general exposition on\nhistorical development of employment law in general and in Ethiopia in\nparticular. Understanding historical development is important because if we do\nnot have an idea as to where we began; and where we are now; we may not have\nan idea as to where we are heading. From this perspective, studying historical\ndevelopment is a worthwhile exercise. The remaining part of the text, other than the final chapter, is broadly divided\ninto two parts (i.e. Part I and Part II). The first part covers “Individual\nx\nA Text Book on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nEmployment Relations” while the second part takes care of issues associated with\nthe so called “Collective Employment Relations”. Within the framework of individual employment relations, we will deal with\nissues of individual nature such as contract of employment; rights and obligations\nof the parties; termination of a contract of employment together with its effects;\ntreatment of special group of employees such as women, young workers,\nemployees with disabilities and foreign workers under the law; and the minimum\nemployment conditions available to every employee as well. The employee as an\nindividual will be the main focus in this part of the text. Part II of the text is devoted towards analysing collective concerns of labour such\nas freedom of association and collective bargaining and the procedures for their\nimplementation. Association brings in organized voice that would countervail\nthe stronger bargaining power of the employer over an individual employee. As\na result, it has been badly needed by employees. However, on the face of\norganized labour, an individual employer would be weak as well.",

    "text": "Thus, within\nthe International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Ethiopian domestic\nregulatory framework, freedom of association is available both to employers and\nemployees though it is more desirable by employees. In the sphere of labour relations, association is not an end by itself. It is with a\nview to obtain better concession from the other party through bargaining that\nsocial partners desire to associate. Thus, more often than not, association is\nfollowed by collective bargaining; and the latter leads towards collective\nagreement. Collective agreement is one of the private instruments through which\nbetter benefits to the employee than what is provided by law or contract of\nemployment may be obtained. These all will be considered under this part. Finally, the concluding chapter will elaborate the nature of employment disputes\ntogether with their modalities of prevention, management and resolution. It is\nwell known that no matter how well articulated, clear and detailed legal\nprovisions may be, disputes in understanding, interpreting and implementing\nthem may occur among stakeholders. Therefore, how to resolve such disputes\nxi\nPreface\nif and when they arise need to be put in place and in advance.

Emergence and\ndevelopment of employment relations in Ethiopia and elsewhere together\nwith the economic basis for its existence will be considered. Generally, employment law is a branch of law that regulates employer and\nemployee relations. Literatures mostly employ phrases such as “labour law”;\n“law of industrial relations” and “work law” interchangeably with\nemployment law. Employment relation is a contract to render service in\nreturn for wages. Relatively speaking, this branch of law is of recent origin\ncompared to other branch of laws of civil nature such as marriage, property,\nsuccession and others. The latter branch of laws has been in existence since\npre-industrial societies. But capital and labour are economic prerequisites for\nemployment law. Capital (surplus product) and ‘free labour’ that can\ncontractually sell out one’s service were not available in pre-industrial\nsocieties. Hence, this branch of law is a manifestation of industrial societies.",

    "text": "Although employment law is a law regulating a special contract to provide\nservice in return for wages, it should be noted that not all service provision\ncontracts in return for remuneration are employment relations. There are\nemployment-like social relations. Their distinctions will be elaborated in due\ncourse. Herein below is an extract from “Privatization in Ethiopia: Its impact on Unionization\nand Collective Bargaining” PhD thesis by Mehari Redae (University of Warwick-UK-\n2015)-footnotes omitted. ( Available at http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk)\n1\nGeneral Introductory Remark\n1.1. Development of Employment Relations in General\nThis section examines the historical development of employment relations\nelsewhere and in Ethiopia and the economic policies and legal frameworks that\nhave been operative at different periods in Ethiopian history. Although broadly\nspeaking employment relation has manifested itself in the form of private sector\nand civil service sector employment regimes, it is the private sector which is more\ncontroversial and a source of much litigation. The main reason for this, as we\nstated above is, while the civil service sector is being regulated by hard and fast\nrules which are inflexible and non-negotiable; the private sector has ample room\nfor flexibility and private ordering. Instruments of private ordering such as work\nrules and collective agreements that govern significant portion of employment\nrelations are non-existent in the civil service sector employment regime. Even\nthe terms of a contract of employment in the civil service sector have little or no\nflexibility. Its terms are more prescribed than negotiated. Thus, the civil service\nsector employment regime is more of an administrative law type than a\ncontractually established employment relationship. Therefore, it must be clear\nfrom the outset that our major focus in this text is the private sector employment\nregime. However, where appropriate and in order to have comparative insight,\nwe may, at times, be compelled to consult the regulatory regime of the civil\nservice sector as well. Documentation of the historical development of employment law is essential to\nan understanding of its present form and content together with anticipating its\nfuture trends. Indeed, it is difficult to understand the current situation properly\nwithout reflecting on the past. From this perspective, documenting historical\ndevelopment is a worthwhile exercise. Actually, in order to situate the Ethiopian\nlabour development within the context of a broader framework, it is informative\nto draw on insights from other sources, in particular those relating to the\ndevelopment of employment relations elsewhere and internationally.",

It was industrialization that led to the emergence of what we know\nas “employment relations”. Industrialization’s economic basis was the interface\nbetween capital and labour. As family labour was no longer sufficient to operate\nthe then cottage industries or to cultivate sizeable farms which were market\noriented, the labour deficit was needed to be filled from the labour market. Thus,\nit was with the emergence of industrialization and industrial development that\nthe demand for surplus labour outside the familial or kin-related labour supply\nwas seriously felt. This situation called for resort to a labour market to satisfy the\ndemand for labour, where ‘free person’ who can freely negotiate to hire (sell)\ntheir labour were available in the market. In a sense, the capital and labour\ninteraction came into being in which capital badly needed labour for economic\ngrowth; while labour relied on capital for livelihood and survival. Since industrialization was either largely non-existent or quite relatively new in\nthe rest of the world, employment relation traces its roots from the historical\nantecedents in Europe and North America. Although the evolution of\nemployment relations had witnessed considerable national variety even in\nEurope, the general pattern of development displayed many similarities. As a\ngeneral path of development, the status-oriented vassal-serf, landlord-tenant and\nthe guild society of the feudal mode of production gradually gave way to a\ncapitalist system where capital-labour mode of production prevailed. As a result,\nthe labour and capital relationship came to the forefront to expressing itself\nthrough freedom of contract and formal equality. Thus, it was a transformation\nfrom status to contract. Under the freedom of contract principles that grew up around industrial\nrevolution in Europe, the formally equal parties designated themselves as\nemployer and employee; and freely bargained to stipulate their terms of\nengagement. The length of engagement of the parties, the amount of wages, any\nlimits on working hours and other related employment issues were left to the\ndetermination of the contracting parties. Each party was at liberty to terminate\nthe contract of employment with cause or with no cause at any time, or in some\n3\nGeneral Introductory Remark\ncases only upon giving notice.",

    "text": "The role of the State then was mainly contract\nenforcement (i.e., enforcing the parties’ promises); if and when requested. The then prevailing ideology was that economic affairs were matters for private\nordering. The interaction of capital and labour was being considered as merely\nand purely economic affairs. It was thus to be regulated solely and exclusively by\nmarket forces and free bargaining. Labour relations were treated as contracts to\nsell or lease services in return for remuneration. For all practical purposes, labour,\nlike any other factor of production, was treated as a commodity whose value was\nto be determined on a supply and demand basis. It was argued that “efficient\nequilibrium would result if the legal framework simply allows market forces to\nfollow their natural course”. In such an engagement, capital, with its stronger bargaining power had the\nadvantage over the weaker bargaining position of labour. As a result, wealth\ncreated through the interaction of capital and labour was being apportioned in\nan inequitable manner under the veil of “freedom of contract”. In a sense, capital\nmanaged to appropriate the “lion’s share” from the wealth generated therein, in\nthe name of business profit, while labour received the minimal amount of it in\nthe form of wages. Indeed, it was not only a matter of appropriation profit; power in labour relations\nwas also exclusively possessed by capital in that the employer had absolute\nprerogative in hiring and firing the labour force as it pleased. Hence, in the\nfreedom of contract regime, profit and power were placed under the full\nauthority of capital (the employer). It could be contended that freedom of contract is fair and just. Because it treats\nthe contracting parties on equal footing and leaves the parties on their own to\ndetermine the terms of their relationship. However, when applied to capital and\nlabour interaction freedom of contract more often than not resulted in subjecting\nlabour to employment insecurity and bare minimum wages. Moreover, labour\nwas exposed to excessively long working hours coupled with unsafe and\nunhealthy working conditions. 4\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIt thus became manifestly clear that freedom of contract between economic non-\nequals would not bring about mutually beneficial outcomes. Therefore, it meant\nmarket did not work well. This market failure called for some sort of state\nintervention with a view to rectifying same. In fact, there was also a\ncomplimentary contention that what should be left to market is price of\ncommodities.",

    "text": "But labour is not a commodity and hence leaving it to market forces\nis unwarranted. Personhood must be respected beyond productive work capacity. The argument goes, behind labour there exits human dignity which is not\nmarketable. As a result, pressing for state intervention in determining matters such as\nminimum wage levels, maximum working hours, employment security and safe\nworking condition moved to the top of the agenda of many emergent labour\nmovements around the world. With this object in view, employees began to\nexpress their discontent towards the so called “freedom of contract” and to\nmilitate against it through organised and unorganised means. At times, the\ndiscontent was being expressed through wild-cat strikes, thereby beginning to\ndestabilize industrial peace. Such collective voice of protest and frequent strikes\nnot only adversely affected productivity and industrial peace but also endangered\nsocial stability particularly in areas where industrialization and organisation of\nlabour movements were at their more advanced level. In fact, in some parts of Europe, in tandum with instability in industrial peace, a\nsocialist ideology that militated against the very existence of the capitalist system\nbegan to emerge at the level of political orientation. The political basis of the\ncapitalist system began to be challenged by Marxist philosophy. As a result, the\nadverse impact of freedom of contract on economic, social and political\ninteractions obtained wider visibility which warranted state intervention. It was\nunderstood that market has been inefficient in addressing the social and political\ndimensions of the relationship between capital and labour. Thus, the notion that employment relations are purely economic affairs began to\nbe revisited. Many governments began to re-assess the appropriateness of leaving\n5\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nemployment relations solely to the mercy of market forces. The need to enact\nsocial legislation in order, among other reasons, to counteract the “structural\ninjustice” between capital and labour was found appropriate. As state power began to emanate from the ballot box instead of through blood\nlines, securing favourable votes of employees was a factor which competing\nparties could not afford to ignore. In a system of universal suffrage and votes of\nequal value, employees inevitably have been numerically attractive. Consequently, the inclusion of pro-labour programmes in electoral campaigns\nbecame the norm in party politics. Hence, it may be safe to state that the need for\nindustrial peace, social stability and the desire to obtain electorate backing\npressed political parties and national governments to intervene in regulating\nindustrial relations that had formerly been left to private ordering.",

    "text": "However, the manner of state intervention differed from jurisdiction to\njurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, governments allowed freedom of association\n(unionization) so that the low bargaining power of individual employees would\nbe compensated through “organized voice”. Once they rectified the negotiation\ninequality, they withheld state intervention then and there (collective laissez-\nfair). Nevertheless, they later realized that there were limits to what could be\nachieved through collective bargaining and that additional legal intervention was\nneeded to fulfil various economic and social policy goals of the state. In other jurisdictions, minimum labour conditions in the form of “floor of rights”\nwere stipulated by law below which a contract of employment cannot prescribe. Terms of a contract of employment which deviate downwards from the legal\nminimum shall be replaced by the legal prescription. The commonality of the\ndifferent interventionist approaches however is they appreciated the need for\nsome sort of state intervention and acted accordingly. Be that as it may, initial attempts of state intervention in labour matters were\nnational in scope and domestic in application without resorting to international\ncooperation and coordination. It may be argued that appreciating the need for\nstate intervention and actually intervening could in itself be considered as a step\n6\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nin the right direction. The limitation with a country specific approach, however,\nwas felt with the proliferation of international trade. While countries began to\ntrade among each other internationally, it was felt that heterogeneous labour\nstandards would impact competitiveness in international trading systems. Those\ncountries with labour friendly regulatory frameworks could stand to lose in\ninternational competition. In fact, many countries that adopted labour protective\nlegislation reconsidered their measure and began to repeal such laws until their\ncompetitive peers introduced laws of equivalent effect so that equilibrium would\nbe established. For instance, there was time when a French law limiting daily working hours to\nten hours for all workers was repealed after five months in force due to the fact\nthat other competing countries were reluctant to follow suit and France was not\nready to sacrifice its competitiveness by so doing. However, it does not\nnecessarily follow that low labour standard is associated with competitiveness. In\nfact, low labour standard would rather be associated with low productivity due\nto labour demotivation, thereby a comparative disadvantage. Nevertheless, it\nshould be noted that perception is not something to be ignored altogether. Thus,\nthe reality on the ground demanded internationally coordinated action. 1.2.",

    "text": "International Cooperation in Employment Matters\nThe establishment of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1919 under\nthe Treaty of Versailles provided a permanent international and institutional\nspace for dealing with the welfare and well-being of labour at the international\nlevel. From its inception, the ILO was entrusted with the responsibility of\nestablishing international labour standards on a wide range of issues with a view\nto implementation by member states in their respective jurisdictions. Hence,\nlabour issues obtained international sponsorship and supervision within the ILO’s\nmandate. Since its establishment the ILO has had a unique tripartite organization. Unlike\nmost, if not all, international organisations whose members are exclusively state\n7\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nofficials (public actors), ILO has consisted of private actors (representatives of\ntrade unions and employers’ associations) within its core representation. For\ninstance, as per Article 3 of the ILO Constitution, member states should\nconstitute their respective core delegation with two government representatives,\none employers’ association representative and another trade union representative\nin order to have formal participation at the ILO Annual Conferences. The\nConference deliberates on international labour standards and adopts legal\ninstruments to be ratified or considered by member states for subsequent\nimplementation. With this arrangement, it could be said that the rule making\nprocess under the ILO has been within the tripartite framework of stakeholders’\nparticipation. The preamble of the ILO Constitution made it clear that the need for\ninternational cooperation and the establishment of the ILO was initiated by a\ndesire to address internationally social, political and economic concerns of the\ntime. These were: “social injustice”; “social unrest (revolution)”; and “social\ndumping”. As regards the struggle against social injustice, the ILO Constitution underlined\nthat social justice would not be attained without respecting labour rights of both\nan individual and collective nature. It further reaffirmed that, “universal and\nlasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice”. With regard to prevention of “social revolution”, though the ILO Constitution\ndid not expressly spell it out (it rather employs the phrase “social unrest”), it\nshould be noted that the circumstance under which the ILO came into existence\nmore or less coincided with the assumption of power of the “Bolsheviks” in Russia\nin 1917. It was thus feared that so long as hardship, exploitation and injustice\ntowards labour existed, the ideology of the “dictatorship of proletariat” of the\n“Bolsheviks” would widen its sphere of influence beyond Russia.",

As a result, devising a general framework for international “floors of rights” to\nemployees was considered as one way of pre-empting social revolution. The fact\nthat the “Russian Revolution” of 1917 and the establishment of the ILO in 1919\noccurred at around the same time is difficult to explain away as being mere\ncoincidence. It can be claimed with some confidence that though pre-emption of\nsocialist revolution may not have been the sole motive for the establishment of\nthe ILO, its establishment was accelerated by the occurrence of the “October\nRevolution” in 1917. The commitment of member states of the ILO to withstand “social dumping” was\nmuch more explicit in the ILO Constitution than the other two missions\nmentioned above. The third paragraph of the preamble placed an emphasis on\nthis issue: “(…) failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an\nobstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in\ntheir own countries”. If adopting humane conditions were to require extra cost\nand thereby increase the cost of production, such products would be less\ncompetitive when introduced into a market where they were competing with\nproducts produced in less humane working conditions. Then if such “regulatory\ncompetition” were to prevail among states at international level, this could\ndiscourage humane concerns towards labour until other competing states\nembarked upon a similar disposition. In order to avoid this practice of “social\ndumping,” responsibility for setting up international labour standard was\nentrusted to the ILO. The three pillars on which the ILO has been entrenched tend to address the\ntripartite interests and concerns of the three important stakeholders in labour\nrelations (i.e. employees, employers and government). Struggle against “social\ninjustice” and expressing a voice for the prevalence of social justice reflects a\npredominantly social issue and mainly benefits the labour force due to labour’s\nvulnerability to hardship and exploitation (i.e. social justice). Fear of “social\n9\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nrevolution” is predominantly a political issue and therefore principally concerns\ngovernments in power since social unrest or even revolution would mainly target\nassumption of state power.",

    "text": "The issue of “social dumping” has economic implications and mainly and directly\naffects the interests of capital (employers) as it harms their competitiveness\nthough this can of course have detrimental consequences for the interests of\nlabour as well. Thus, it is important to note that not only at national level but at\nthe international sphere as well; labour relations have social, political and\neconomic dimensions. What emerges from the preceding discussion is that the employment relationship\nhas undergone significant transformation over-time. Initially, it was treated as a\nprivate contractual matter to be regulated by freedom of contract. With passage\nof time, state intervention at national level became desirable. Thereafter, the\ninadequacy of intervention at nation state level paved the way for international\ncooperation and establishment of a permanent international institution. Therefore, the general trend of employment regulation has gone through\ndifferent stages of transformation: from a pure subject matter of private contract\nof service, it became a subject of national concern where states began to\nintervene. Finally, it attained the status of an issue of serious international\nconcern. With these brief introductory remarks, we will hereafter consider the\ndevelopment of employment relations in Ethiopia with the object of shedding\nlight on its similarity with or difference from the general trend of development\nindicated above. 1.3. Evolution of the Economic Basis for Employment Relations in\nEthiopia\nEthiopian labour relation is in some degree an outcome of a slow and prolonged\neconomic and social transformation. Historical records indicate that Ethiopian\nlabour development was very much associated with the emergence of industries\n10\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nand industrial production systems. For a long time, Ethiopia was mainly an\nagrarian economy existing alongside handicraft activity. Due to this, the capitalist\nmode of production was slow to develop and limited in coverage. Guadagni\nargued that the cultural and legal conditions that prevailed in the country at the\ntime had negatively contributed to the slow development of the capitalist\neconomy. Culturally, Ethiopian society had undervalued labour and labourers and indeed\ntended to despise both trade and manual work. There has, for instance, been an\nEthiopian (Amharic) proverb which states that kemesrat barnet, kemenager\ngetnet (literally meaning - from cleverness of hands comes serfdom and from\ncleverness of tongue, the master).",

    "text": "It was recorded that this adverse societal\nattitude towards labour had annoyed the early twentieth century ruler of the\ncountry, Emperor Menelik II, who proclaimed the following in 1908:\nLet those who insult the worker on account of his labour cease to do so. You by your insults and insinuations are about to leave my country\nwithout artisans who even make the plough. Hereafter any one of you\nwho insults these people is insulting me personally (Mahteme Selassie,\n1949:432). As legal prescriptions would be less likely to provide a lasting remedy to\ncountervail deep rooted cultural biases, cultural transformation through formal\neducation and awareness raising activities would have offered more chance of\nsuccess. But the proclamation of the Emperor was not accompanied by any of\nthese measures. Thus, the negative attitude towards labour persisted thereby\nadversely affecting industriousness and industrial development. Through passage of time however, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a\ncapitalist mode of production began to emerge in Ethiopia. The victory by the\nEthiopian forces at the Battle of Adwa (1896) against the Italian invasion was a\nsignificant success for Emperor Menelik II. The military success enhanced\nEthiopia’s international visibility and   enabled the Emperor to discuss on equal\nfooting with European powers matters of common interest and concern on equal\n11\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nfooting. As a consequence, the Emperor began to establish formal diplomatic ties\nwith the European super powers of the time (Britain, France and Italy) all of\nwhom had a colonial presence bordering Ethiopia. The neighbouring countries were by then under the occupation of these\nEuropean powers. Eritrea was then under Italian colonial administration; the\nSudan was under British rule, while Djibouti was under French domination and\nKenya belonged to the British colonial system. Moreover, two of the colonial\npowers had colonial presence in present day Somalia (Italian Somaliland and\nBritish Somaliland). These colonial territories by then had a relatively advanced capitalist\ndevelopment than the feudal but non-colonised Ethiopia. Through the long and\nporous borders of the country, capitalist elements, ideas and attitudes were being\nintroduced through the medium of missionaries and missionary schools,\nmerchants and diplomatic envoys. Thus, initial capitalist modes of production in\nEthiopia were transplantations and a spill-over from the neighbouring colonial\nterritories rather than the result of an internally cultivated dynamism and\neconomic transformation. The conventional path towards capitalist development as observed in many\nindustrial countries has been a transformation from peasant farming to\nmechanised agriculture and from artisans and handicrafts to factory and\nmachinery establishments.",

    "text": "In the African continent too, industries for primary\nproducts mainly mining and agricultural estates were the economic basis for\ninitial industrial relations. In a sense, it was the agriculture and the\nmanufacturing sectors that developed first and a service sector (the third\ngeneration of economic development) emerged and developed at a later time in\neconomic transformation. Conversely, in Ethiopia, railway, telecommunication and banking services were\nthe earliest capitalist establishments. The commencement of the construction of\nthe Ethio-Djibouti Railway (in 1889) by the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company,\nthe project for the establishment of telephone and telegraph connections along\n12\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nthe railway lines by the same company and the incorporation of the Bank of\nAbyssinia by the National Bank of Egypt were the earliest capitalist\nestablishments in Ethiopia. The establishment of these service provider economic\nentities at the initial phase of the country’s capitalist development illustrated that\nEthiopia’s early capitalist development was not a result of an internal dynamism;\nrather primarily and predominantly an imported one. It could thus be contended\nthat the Ethiopian capitalist development was atypical both in the type of\neconomic activity and in its foreign origins. The infrastructure projects referred to above attracted appreciable numbers of\nlabourers from the countryside. But as the projects had a defined life span, the\nemployment status of the Ethiopians was temporary in nature. Consequently,\nmost were compelled to return to their respective agricultural plots after the\ncompletion of the projects. Thus, they neither had the opportunity to upgrade\ntheir skills nor to acquire workplace discipline on a permanent basis. As a result,\nthe local labour profile at those times was mainly unskilled and casual. In a sense,\nagricultural activity remained the employer of last resort for a long time. Through time, however, many foreigners showed heightened interest in the\nEthiopian economy and engaged in concessionary arrangements with the\nEthiopian government in mining and agriculture. Since the attempt to occupy\nand colonise Ethiopia by force proved unsuccessful, concessionary and\nconsensual ties became feasible ways of tapping the country’s unexploited\nresources. In 1899 a Swiss Company, owned by Alfred Ilg, a political adviser to\nthe Emperor, invested in the mining industry in Wollega (in the western part of\nthe country) while around the same time an English company engaged itself in\nan agricultural investment in Kaffa (in the south-western part of the country) and\nmining in Wollega.",

Those economic initiatives were complemented by the emergence and\ndevelopment of urban centres.

Unlike his predecessors who used to change their Imperial seats\nfrequently, due to various factors including problems of security; the availability\nof drinking water and firewood, he eventually opted for a more permanent\nsettlement for his administration. Based on this more sedentary approach, the beginning of the twentieth century\nwas characterized by the construction of palaces, churches and hotels in and\naround Addis Ababa which has ever since been the capital city of the country. The Grand Palace of Menelik, Taytu Hotel and the various churches such as Saint\nMary, Saint George and Saint Raguel located in and around Addis Ababa were all\nconstructed during those times. Moreover, the completion of the Djibouti-Addis\nAbaba railway led to the establishment of towns such as Dire Dawa along the\nrailway route within the Ethiopian hinterland. Those various economic and social activities in service, agriculture, mining and\nconstruction sectors in the country brought about the emergence of significant\nnumbers of the workforce detached from an agrarian economy towards an\nurbanised one on a relatively permanent basis. The establishment of the urban\ncentres, for their part, paved the way for a more permanent and settled urban\nlivelihood and hence founded the main economic basis for the emergence of\nemployment relations in Ethiopia. 1.4. Development of Employment Law in Ethiopia\n1.4.1. Employment law during the Imperial Era\nThe cultural attitude towards labour and labourers and its adverse effect to labour\ndevelopment of the country has already been mentioned above. The\nunfavourable legal environment at the time was responsible for hindering the\ndevelopment of employment relations as well. Although Ethiopia, as noted\npreviously, is one of the oldest members of both the League of Nations and the\nILO, having acceded to both institutions in 1923, slavery was an entrenched and\nlegally recognized social relation in the country until it was abolished by law in\n14\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n1942. It was pursuant to Slavery Abolition Proclamation of 1942 that the legal\nstatus of slavery was formally abolished. Admittedly, prior to this proclamation, there was a Proclamation issued in 1931\nwhich attempted to abolish slavery.",

    "text": "The relevant provisions of that proclamation\nstated as follows: ‘All slaves who wished to be free could become free by asserting\ntheir freedom before a judge’. It further provided for the punishment of persons\nwho bought and sold slaves or who sought to prevent slaves from asserting their\nfreedom. However, this was not bold enough to abolish slavery altogether. First,\nthe proclamation addressed itself to slaves ‘who wished to be free’ but not to all\nslaves. If for whatever reason people wanted to remain slaves, the law had no\nobjection. Second, even for those ‘who wished to be free’, the freedom was not\nautomatic and as of right; it rather required the blessing of the judge because the\nlaw expected them to assert their right before a judge. Third, the Proclamation\ndid not put enforceable sanctions on those who might sought to prevent slaves\nfrom asserting their freedom. Of course, the law claimed to have provided for\npunishment but the then criminal law had no explicit provision in this regard. It\nis a well established criminal law maxim that no crime and no punishment\nwithout law. It was with the promulgation of the Slavery (Abolition)\nProclamation No.22/1942 that the legal status of slavery was declared to be\nabolished (Article 3). Even then, due to absence of sanction, it had no dissuasive\neffect. It was after 15 years and with the coming in to force of the Penal Code of\n1957 that “Enslavement” was validly criminalized. Article 565 of the same\nstipulated the following:\n1) Whosoever:\na) Enslaves another, sells, alienates, pledges or buys him, or trades or traffics\nin or exploits him; or\nb) Keeps or maintains another in condition of slavery, even in disguised form\nis punishable with rigorous imprisonment from five to twenty years and a\nfine not exceeding twenty thousand dollars. 15\nGeneral Introductory Remark\n2) Those who knowingly carry oft, transport or conduct, whether by land, by sea\nor by air, persons thus enslaved, in order to deliver them at their place of\ndestination, or who aid and abet such traffic, whether within the territory of\nthe Empire or abroad, are liable to the same punishments. As employment relationships presuppose the availability of “free” persons who\ncan freely bargain over their labour, the prevalence of slavery as a legally\nrecognized mode of social relation was incompatible with the emergence of\nemployment relations.",

    "text": "Thus, the negative cultural attitude of Ethiopian society\ntowards labour; and the legal recognition of the status of slavery were among the\nfactors responsible for the slow and limited development of employment\nrelations in Ethiopia. However, the Italian invasion over Ethiopia at the beginning of the Second\nWorld War (1936) led to the emergence of labour intensive industries supportive\nto the war efforts of the invading force (such as oil, flour and saw mills; textile,\nleather, cement, food and beverage factories). Due to the labour intensiveness\nof those manufacturing enterprises and the relative permanent employment\nstatus of their labour force, the number of people who earned their livelihood\nthrough employment increased. Moreover, with the formation of garrison\ntowns in different parts of the country, appreciable number of people\ndetached from agricultural activity began to emerge. Even though the labour force showed a significant quantitative increase, there\nexisted no legal framework designed to regulate the employment relationship. By\ndefault, “freedom of contract” became the legal basis for the parties’ relationship\nand employees then were to a significant extent at the mercy of their employers. It has been even contended that for all practical purposes the relationship was\nmore of master and servant rather than an employer and employee. Three years after the defeat of the Italians, and two years after the 1942\nproclamation of the abolition of the status of slavery in Ethiopia, the government\npromulgated the Factories’ Proclamation No. 58/1944, an important legal\n16\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\ninstrument relevant to employment relations. By virtue of this Proclamation, the\nthen Ministry of Commerce and Industry was entrusted with the power to issue\nrules on:\n­ the working hours in factories;\n­ the prevention of accidents in factories;\n­ the health and safety of all persons employed in factories;\n­ the conditions under which buildings to be used as factory housing may be\nerected and constructed;\nIn addition to these measures, the Ministry was empowered to appoint “labour\ninspectors” to carry out supervision and monitoring activities over the factories\nwith a view to ensuring the observance of the rules. Those measures showed that\nthe government realized the need for a limited state intervention in labour\nrelations mainly on limiting working hours; safety and health issues in factories. In real terms, however, records indicated that the Factories’ Proclamation of 1944\ndid not have any impact on the ground. This was because for one thing the way\nit was drafted was not self-executing.",

    "text": "The legislature merely delegated power to\nthe Ministry to issue rules rather than spelling out precise and enforceable\nprovisions by its own. Second, the Ministry did not make use of any of the powers\nentrusted to it, nor did the legislature monitor the exercise of such power by the\nMinistry. Apart from the controversy as to the articulation of the Factories’ Proclamation,\na further limitation was that its scope of application was confined to working\nconditions in factories (i.e. the manufacturing sector). The employees at\nagricultural plantations or in mining and other sectors of the economy who were\nequally vulnerable to risks such as excessive working hours, and threats against\ntheir health and life at workplaces were outside of its coverage as their places of\nwork were not technically “factories”. In fact, the first recorded workers’ protest\nin Ethiopian history had been undertaken in 1915 by construction workers in\nAddis Ababa whose main discontent was associated with unsafe working\nconditions. 17\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nNotwithstanding the limitations referred to above, it can be argued that the\nFactories’ Proclamation was an appreciable measure. It showed that the\ngovernment realized the desirability of some level of state intervention in labour\naffairs. In particular, the adoption of the Factories’ Proclamation only two years\nafter the abolition of slavery indicated that the government recognized the\nabolition of slavery and replacing it by “contractual freedom” was not enough\nassurance to protect labour. Nevertheless, since the Ministry entrusted with the\nresponsibility did not act upon its powers, the legislative measure was merely a\npublic relation exercise and not much more than a mere expression of concern or\ninterest. Until 1960, the 1944 Factories’ Proclamation was not supplemented in any way\nwith further legislation. It was only in 1960 that the Civil Code was enacted. The\n1960 Civil Code comprehensively regulated many of the social and pecuniary\nrelations of private life such as marriage, succession, contracts and property. As\npart of this comprehensive regulatory effort, the Code devoted a section (Title\nXVI) on “Contracts for the Performance of Services”, which mainly addressed\nissues of contracts of employment. With the coming into force of the Civil Code, minimum labour conditions which\nhad the effect of modifying the application of the terms of contractual freedom\nwere spelt out.",

Employment law during the Military Rule\nOn 12 September 1974, Ethiopia entered a new era, one of military rule, after its\nlongstanding Imperial administration through hereditary line. A Military\nCouncil, locally known as the Derg (literally a “Committee”) seized political\npower in 1974 by ousting the Emperor from the Imperial Palace. The assumption\nof power by the military ‘put an end to a dynasty that traced its origins to King\nSolomon and the Queen of Sheba’. Immediately after its assumption of power,\nthe Derg dissolved the then existing bicameral parliament; and restricted by law,\nany form of dissent including peaceful assembly and demonstration. Furthermore, in terms of political and economic philosophy, the ‘West’ oriented\ncapitalist path of development of the feudo-capitalist system of the Imperial era\nwas redirected towards a socialist path of development. At the initial phases of the military reign, it appeared that the Derg did not have\na clear ‘road map’ as to the direction of its economic policy and ideology. With a\nview to rallying public support, it declared that its motto was to be ‘Ethiopia\nTikdem (literally ‘Ethiopia First’) an apparently ideology-neutral motto but a\nnationalist and patriotic slogan. However, the military gradually transformed its\nway of thinking and slogan into a more ideologically influenced motto of\n‘Ethiopian Socialism’ in response to the pressure of left leaning groups including\nthe Ethiopian student movements. Gradually the Derg moved to becoming a\ncommunist-oriented. Marxist-Leninist writings which were prohibited until\nthen began to officially appear at the book stores. Pictures of Marx, Engels and\nLenin were erected at the main squares of the major cities of the country. In parallel with the political and ideological development mentioned above, a\nnew economic policy for the country was adopted in February, 1975 and an\nextract from the Economic Policy reads as follows:\n(…) the major and immediate economic goals of Ethiopian Socialism\ncannot be but the elimination of poverty through the development of\nproductive forces and the consequent expansion of production, and the\nprevention of exploitation of the Ethiopian people.",

( Underline added- GOE, 1975:3). Accordingly, the military government adopted practical measures of\n“nationalisation” of private property. Privately owned major means of production\nand distribution were transferred to government ownership in January and\nFebruary 1975. In March of the same year, it was proclaimed that rural land was\nplaced under state ownership to be followed by the nationalisation of privately\nowned urban land and extra houses in July 1975. This takeover of the private\nproperty and means of production by the government made the latter the major\nemployer, not only in the sphere of public services, but on the economic front as\nwell. Thus, the State transformed itself from an organ of regulatory power into\nan economic entity engaged in owning and managing business enterprises\nretaining its regulatory power intact at the same time. As a reflection of this political and economic transformation, a new labour law\nwas issued in February, 1975 (Labour Proclamation No. 64/1975). The political\nrhetoric, at the time, was that the employee is at the same time the owner of the\nnationalised enterprises. Employment generation to the working class was taken\nas an objective of prime importance. As a result, the Labour Proclamation mainly\naddressed the issue of employment security by stipulating strict labour market\nprovisions on hiring and firing procedures. First, it required ‘every enterprise to\nreport all job vacancies to an Employment Office as soon as they occur’ and it was\nonly from the registered job-seekers that the enterprise was allowed to hire. At\nthe level of firing, it laid down the principle stating that ‘any contract of\nemployment shall be deemed to have been concluded for an indefinite period’. Based on this principle, even if the contract of employment was concluded for a\ndefinite period, it was considered to have been concluded for an indefinite period,\nif the job was of a continuos nature. Consequently, it was the nature of the job\nrather than the terms of the contract of employment that determined the\nduration of employment.",

    "text": "Second, the law exhaustively enumerated what were\n21\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nconsidered to be lawful grounds for termination of employment; and any\ntermination outside of those listed were held unlawful and hence entitled the\ndismissed employee to reinstatement with back pay. This marked a paradigm shift from the Civil Code era where the employer had\nthe prerogative to terminate employment with “good cause”. And what amounts\nto “good cause” for termination was a matter to be determined by the employer. Of course, the decision of the employer was subject to revision by a court if the\ncase was brought to the court’s attention by the dismissed employee. Even if the\ncourt held that there was no good cause for termination, the employer was never\ncompelled to reinstate the employee. Payment of compensation to the maximum\nof three (six months wage based on the English version of the Code. But the\nAmharic version has been the prevailing version) months’ wage of the employee\nwas the sole remedy for terminations without “good cause”. The amount of\ncompensation was revised by Regulation No.302/1964 in which the terminated\nemployee was eligible for one month’s wage for one year of service; and 25% of\nsuch amount to be added for every addition year of service in the form of\nseverance pay the maximum being wages of 180 days. Conversely, the labour law of the military regime legislatively determined and\nexhaustively spelt out the lawful grounds for termination. Thus, the employer or\nthe court had little or no room for case-by-case determination. In cases where\nthe dismissal was found to be out of the lawful grounds of termination, the sole\nremedy (unless the employee did not want to be reinstated) was awarding of\nreinstatement to the employee even against the objection of the employer. In\nfact, reinstatement was to be accompanied by back pay as the contract was\ndeemed not to have been terminated. Incurring the cost of back pay without the enterprise obtaining service from the\nreinstated employee had serious cost implications for the enterprises. Hence, cost\nof firing was very high. Moreover, employers had no power to dismiss employees\non disciplinary grounds unless prescribed by a collective agreement in which case\nthe trade union would have to agree on the measure. Consequently, during the\n22\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nmilitary rule, the employment relationship became a relationship far more\n‘intimate’ than a legally regulated contractual relation, thereby providing higher\nemployment security to the employees.",

As regards the social entitlements, the paid annual leave, maternity leave and sick\nleave, which have been introduced by the Civil Code of 1960, were maintained\nby the new proclamation in a prolonged duration and with higher pay benefits. The fact that the military regime adopted a socialist-oriented path of economic\ndevelopment seemed to have shaped the content of its labour proclamation\ntowards apparently pro-labour prescriptions. In fact, the preamble of the Labour\nProclamation of the military regime provided that “…the worker [employee] is\nthe source and foundation of all production and as such his rights to work free\nfrom exploitation and the proper protection of his safety and health must be\nassured in order to improve his standard of living”. The role of capital was not\nequally emphasized in the same preamble though it is equally and economically\nrelevant input. 1.4.3. Employment law during the post-Military Rule\nSoon after the overthrow of the military regime in 1991, Ethiopia adopted a\nmarket-oriented economy. Privatization programme was introduced and the\nstate began to roll-back from the economy. Most of the state-owned enterprises\nwere privatized mainly owing to the prescriptions of the multilateral lending and\ndonor institutions such as the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary\nFund (IMF). The WB and IMF prescribed “privatize as soon as possible; and as\nmuch as possible” as a condition to obtain loan and technical assistance\ntherefrom. The state had little option than to comply with their prescriptions as\nit heavily relied on loans and donations. In light of the new economic circumstance of the country, a relatively private\nsector friendly, labour law was enacted in 1993 (Labour Proclamation No. 23\nGeneral Introductory Remark\n42/1993) which superseded the labour law of the military government. The\nlabour law of 1993 maintained the social provisions such as annual leave and sick\nleave with pay which were available to the employees on the basis of the previous\nlaw in similar length. In fact, maternity leave has even been extended in duration. The presumption of indefinite employment relationship in which a contract of\nemployment of definite period has been deemed to have been concluded for\nindefinite period was retained as well.

It is only when termination is initiated on\nspecific “prohibited grounds” that the new law provides for reinstatement as a\nsole remedy. Article 26(2) has enumerated these grounds. In all other cases, the\nlabour tribunal is empowered to award either reinstatement or compensation as\nit deems appropriate on a case-by-case basis. Thus, unlike during the military regime where the remedy was dictated by the\nlaw itself, the new law gives room for a margin of flexibility to labour tribunals\nto render case-by-case decisions, whether to award reinstatement or\ncompensation instead. The third point of difference is that under the current law\neven if the labour tribunal awards reinstatement it is not to be accompanied by\nfull back pay as there is no payment without rendering service. Regardless of how\n24\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nlong the litigation for reinstatement takes, it is only a maximum of six months’\nwage that will be paid in the form of back pay at the level of first instance court. Even though Labour Proclamation No.377/2003 and Labour Proclamation\nNo.1156/2019 have been relevant for our discussion, since they are of recent\ninstruments and presently operative instruments, it was considered advisable to\nexplore them in more depth at a later part of this textbook. 1.4.4. Summary\nIt is hoped that the narrative on historical development of employment relations\nboth nationally and internationally has provided an insight as to the stages it\npassed through.",

    "text": "It has been shown that the economic basis for employment\nrelations has been accumulated capital (no matter how meagre it may be) which\ndemand surplus labour on the one hand; and free person (emancipated from\nslavery and tenancy) who can contractually hire their labour freely on the other\nhand. This was made possible with the emergence of capitalist mode of\nproduction. In common with the experience of other countries, employment relations in\nEthiopia were initially left to private regulation within the framework of\n“contractual freedom”. State intervention in employment issues, through\ndirectly legislating substantive employment protections, took place at a later stage\nmainly since 1960s. Unsurprisingly the economic policy and the political orientation of the successive\nEthiopian governments (the Imperial era, the Derg era and the post-military rule)\nhave had an impact on the content of the legal framework for employment\nrelations. Although the three successive governments replaced one another by\nforce rather than through democratic transfer of power, all of them realized the\nneed for some sort of state intervention in labour affairs. Nevertheless, the degree\nof intervention they adopted reflected their economic policy and political\norientations. 25\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nIt is certainly possible to identify even before the 1960s the international\ninfluences on Ethiopian labour relations and the emerging legal framework. The\ncolonial presence of the great European powers in the early 20th century adjacent\nto Ethiopia and the five years of Italian occupation in the late 1930s helped\nintroduce capitalist economic relations. The early ILO membership of Ethiopia\nand the modernisation of its legal system in early 1960s contributed in bringing\nabout labour laws in the country. As a reflection of this, the 1960s operative labour law adopted a less rigid position\nwith a view to providing labour market flexibility through which, among other\nthings, the cost of hiring and firing was less costly. On the other hand, the\ninfluence of the communist ideology during the military regime to a great extent\ninfluenced the legal framework of labour relations of the time which over-\nemphasized employment security presumably consistent with its socialist-\noriented path of development policy. During the post-military period, due to the influence of the WB and the IMF\nprescriptions of ‘deregulation’ including labour market deregulation, on the one\nhand; and the commitment towards the ILO principles on the other, the\ngovernment issued an employment law that manifested such a dilemma.",

How has Ethiopia’s historical development influenced the scope of\nemployment law? What about the foreign experience? Did it have any\ninfluence on the contents of our employment law? 2. Please think of and identify relevant economic, political and other\nfactors, if any, which led the Ethiopian government of the 1960s for the\nheightened concern towards labour in the period under consideration\n(1960-1966)? 1.5. Sources of Employment Law in Ethiopia\nFor the purpose of this text, source of law is understood in two ways. These are\nthe material and formal sources. Material source denotes to the origin from which\nlegal rules are derived. From this perspective, legal rules may originate from other\nnon-legal norms such as customs, religious prescriptions or moral values. This\nunderstanding of source of law is mainly important for studying legal history. In this section, we are rather interested on the so called “formal sources of law.” This means legal instruments expressed in various forms which have state\nbacking for their validity and binding effect. In a sense these are instruments\nwhich should be authoritatively consulted in regulating employment relations\nand in resolving employment disputes if and when they occur. In light of this,\nsources of employment law may be broadly categorized into international and\nnational sources. The international formal sources mainly consist of ILO conventions to which\nEthiopia is a party. International human rights instruments which are ratified by\nEthiopia are relevant as well, since they enshrine provisions necessary for\nemployment relations. These are international because they are the outcome of\nconsultation among international public actors (i.e. representatives of various\ngovernments). They are not made by any national legislature unilaterally as well. 27\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nIn fact, in the making of ILO conventions, in addition to public actors, uniquely,\nprivate actors such as representatives of employees’ and employers’ organizations\nhave been involved. These are laws because they have binding effect due to the\nfact that any international agreement (convention in this case) ratified by\nEthiopia is an integral law of the land (Article 9(4) of the Federal Constitution of\nEthiopia).",

    "text": "The national formal sources comprise various instruments with different levels\nof hierarchy. They are national because, unlike the international ones, they\nemanate from a national organ (legislature) or an organ authorized or delegated\nby it. Their issuance by a pertinent organ grants them validity and binding effect. In this regard, the Federal Constitution is placed at the top of the hierarchical\nladder. Although the constitutional adoption and amendment process is mostly\ndifferent from other ordinary laws; and though in the Ethiopian context,\nconstitution does not emanate from the legislature, the validity and supremacy\nof the Constitution is uncontested. In fact, it is the only legal instrument that\nbinds even the legislature. The Constitution has incorporated many fundamental\nprinciples relevant in formulating legal framework for employment relations. Problem for discussion:\nIt is assumed that you have already studied Constitutional Law in your\nprevious years of law studies. Please identify the principles incorporated\nin the Ethiopian Constitution which have relevance to employment\nrelations. Please come up with as many principles as possible; and explain\nwhy you hold that the principles are relevant to the subject matter. In this category and below the Constitution, proclamation is an important source\nof law. Particularly, the Labour Proclamation almost comprehensively regulates\nemployment relations in the private sector; and hence it is a comprehensive\ninstrument. In many jurisdictions, employment relation is regulated by pieces of\n28\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nlegislation such as; law of individual employment relations, law of dismissal,\nfreedom of association act, collective bargaining act, the law on strike, law on\noccupational safety and health, workmen’s compensation act, labour inspection\nservice law etc. The Ethiopian labour law consists of all of these in a single\ndocument, essentially a code. However, there are other proclamations which\nregulates newly emerging issues, such as “the Private Employees Organization\nSocial Security Proclamation”; “Employment of Persons with Disability\nProclamation” which are also relevant for employment relations. The relevant\nprovisions of the Civil Code have also a gap filling mission. An important point to determine, at this level, is whether issuance of labour is a\nfederal matter or state matter or of concurrent jurisdiction. In federated states,\nstate power is being exercised at different levels: at the level of the federation and\nat the level of member states. Such power is apportioned by the Constitution. One of the state powers is law making. Thus, where the power rests need to be\nresolved.",

    "text": "This requires us to consult the Constitution. Based on the constitutional\npower allocation, enactment of labour code is an exclusive federal power. It is\nneither state matter nor within concurrent jurisdiction. Therefore, as the\nConstitution now stands, if states issue labour law, it would not be a valid source\nof law. However, in some jurisdictions, labour law is within concurrent jurisdiction. For\nexample, in the United States, there are both federal and state employment laws. Federal laws set out minimum standards for the entire country. For instance, the\nUS Federal Fair Labour Standards Act, prescribe a minimum wage for the nation. An individual state might decide, however, to increase protections to workers\nbeyond the legal minimum. As such, a state might decide to raise minimum wage\nbeyond the federal minimum to reflect local economic conditions and the cost of\nliving within the state. 29\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nProblem for discussion:\nWhy should labour law be under federal jurisdiction? In the US where a federal structure is in place, labour matters, as indicated\nabove, are within concurrent jurisdiction. Would the US approach be\nmuch more convincing than ours? Why? Why not? In terms of legislative competence, the situation is different when it comes to the\ncivil service employment regime. The federal government and the regional states\nare empowered to organize their respective civil service institutions and\nadminister their civil servants. Consequently, the source of law for the civil\nservice employment regime would be both at federal and state levels. The Federal\nCivil Servants’ Proclamation will govern federal civil servants; while the regional\ncivil service laws shall govern civil servants in their respective regions. Another source of law for employment relation is a Council of Ministers\nRegulations. Almost all proclamations, including the Labour Proclamation and\nthe Federal Civil Servants’ Proclamation delegate the Council of Ministers to\nissue Regulations for the proper implementation of the Proclamations. In fact,\nthe Council has already issued some Regulations on the basis of the delegation. For instance, pursuant to the power given to it under Article 3(3)(b) of the Labour\nProclamation, the Council of Ministers issued Regulation No.342/2015 that\ngoverns employment relations established by religious and charitable\norganizations. Directive is also another regulatory instrument which is delegated to the Minister\nof Labour and Social Affairs (MOLSA) (recently the Ministry has been renamed\nas “Ministry of Labour and Skills”) with a view to the proper implementing the\nLabour Proclamation.",

    "text": "For instance, the Minister, by virtue of the power entrusted\nto it under the Labour Proclamation has issued Directives such as: “procedure for\nreduction of work force”; “procedures on the establishment of Permanent\n30\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAdvisory Board”; a directive prescribing activities prohibited for young workers;\nand a directive prescribing activities prohibited for women workers. Similar delegation has been granted to the Civil Service Commission with respect\nto the implementation of the Federal Civil Service Proclamation. In fact based on\nthe Proclamation providing for employment of persons with disability, since it\nregulates disabled persons both the private and public sector employment, it gives\nconcurrent directive issuance power to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs\nand to the Civil Service Commission. The intention is the Directive to be issued\nby the Ministry will be applied on the private sector employment regime\n(including state owned enterprises), while the Directive to be issued by the\nCommission is meant for the civil service sector employment regime. Finally, since recently (2005), the judiciary has become another source of law. Of\ncourse, court decisions at all levels are binding on the concerned parties to the\nlitigation before them. That decision cannot, in principle, bind third parties to\nthe dispute. However, the Ethiopian legal system has introduced judicial\nprecedent where the interpretation of the Federal Supreme Court Cassation\nDivision shall be binding on courts at all levels in future similar factual and legal\nsituations (Proclamation No.454/2005; Article 2(1). Thus, Cassation Division\ndecisions are currently source of laws. In another note, in connection with the private sector employment regime, there\nare additional private regulatory instruments which need to be complied with. These are: individual contracts of employment, collective agreements and work\nrules. The first two are bilateral instruments while the third one is unilateral. Technically, these are private instruments emanating from private actors. Individual contract of employment a contract entered into by and between an\nemployer and employee which regulates their employment relations. Similarly,\ncollective agreement is a contract entered into by an employer and trade union\nrepresentatives at enterprise level or between employer associations on the one\nhand and trade unions on the other. They are the result of negotiation and\nagreement of the parties. These parties are private persons and hence the\n31\nGeneral Introductory Remark\ninstruments made by them are private instruments as well.",

    "text": "But, though they are\nnot made by public actors, the legislature has promised to enforce them as they\nwere law, pursuant to Article 1731 of the Civil Code. Thus, they are as good as\nlaw though they are aspects of private ordering. There is also another private instrument of employment relations that deserves\nbrief explanation. This is a work rule. Unlike the above two, it is a unilateral\ninstrument. The employer, in its prerogative as an employer, has been authorized\nto issue internal rules pertaining to working conditions at enterprise level that\nshould be observed by employees. In this sense, it is binding on the employees\nthough they did not consent to it. Its limitations will be discussed in due course. 1.6. Scope of Employment Law\nGenerally, employment law regulates a commitment to provide service in return\nfor remuneration. But, it does not mean all commitments to provide services in\nanticipation of payment are employment relations. There are other\n“employment-like” relationships. Therefore, in order to determine the scope of\nthe law, there is a need to distinguish employment relations from other similar\nengagements. In fact, determining the nature of the relationship is not only\nrelevant to employment law. It is relevant to other branches of law as well. For\ninstance, determining the nature of the relationship is essential to establish tax\nliability. If the relationship is employer-employee, the employer is obligated to\ndeduct the income tax due to the employee at payroll; whereas if the relationship\nis other than this, no such liability is imposed upon the service recipient. Moreover, in extra-contractual liability cases, vicarious liability arises in\nemployer-employee affairs while the others provide service at their own risk. Finally, under the law of bankruptcy, employees have priority of claims over\nother creditors in settling debts. Be that as it may, there has been similarity and, at times, confusion in\ndifferentiating between employer-employee relationship; client-contractor\nrelationship and principal-agent relationships. These three relations are defined\n32\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nand spelt out under the Civil Code of 1960. For the benefit of clarity, it seems\nappropriate to reproduce the relevant provisions hereunder.

    "text": "Article 2199: Definition\nAgency is a contract whereby a person, the agent, agrees with another, the\nprincipal, to represent him and to perform on his behalf one or several\nlegally binding acts’. Article 2512: Contract of employment\nA contract of employment is a contract whereby one party, the employee,\nundertakes to render to the other party, the employer, under the latter’s\ndirection, for a determined or undetermined time, services of a physical or\nintellectual nature, in consideration of wages which the employer\nundertakes to pay him. Article 2610: Definition\nA contract of work and labour is a contract whereby one party, the\ncontractor, undertakes to produce a given result, under his own\nresponsibility, in consideration of remuneration that the other party, the\nclient, undertakes to pay him. As can be gathered from the provisions above, the agent, the employee and the\ncontractor are committing themselves to render some sort of service to the other\nparty; the principal, the employer and the client respectively. The agent is to\nprovide service of “representation” while the employee undertakes “to render\nservices of physical or intellectual nature.” The contractor for his part is to\nprovide the service of “producing a given result.” These being their commonality,\nthere are variations among them as well. 33\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nPrincipal-agent relationship may emanate either from the operation of the law\nor contract (Articles 2179 and 2199) while the source for employer-employee and\nclient-contractor relationships is solely a contract. It may also be possible that\nprincipal-agent engagement could be a free service as payment is not part of the\ndefinitional elements of the relationship. Employer-employee and client-\ncontractor relationships are entered into for consideration as their definition\nincluded payment (i.e. wage for employee; and remuneration for the contractor). Thus, there is no pro bono service in employer-employee; and client-contractor\nrelationships. Another difference could be the nature of service. An agent’s service to its\nprincipal is entering into one or more legally binding acts in the name and on\nbehalf of the principal. In this sense its service is very specific and limited to\nperforming of juridical acts (i.e. representation). On the contrary, employees and\ncontractors render service of any sort to their employers and clients respectively\nwithout binding the latter.",

    "text": "Up to now, we have seen the differences between principal-agent relationship on\nthe one hand; and employer-employee and client-contractor relationship on the\nother. This does not however mean that the latter two relationships are identical. They rather have differences. One such difference is the degree of authority the\none party has over the other. In client-contractor relationship, the contractor is to offer its service “under its\nown responsibility” while in employer-employee relationship, the employee is\nrequired to render its service “under the employer’s direction.” Thus the degree\nof authority the client has over the contractor is loose in the sense that the client\nis interested on a given result. A contractor is one who engages to perform a\ncertain service for another, according to his own manner and method, free from\nthe control and direction of his client in all matters connected with the\nperformance of the service, except as to the result of the work. Conversely, in the employer-employee relationship the employer is not only\ninterested on the given result but on the manner of achieving the result as well. 34\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nThe employer may be interested to have control as to what to do; how to do it;\nwith whom to do it; when and where to do it. Hence the level of authority the\nemployer has over the employee is very high which amounts to vertical\n(superior- subordinate relationship) rather than a horizontal one. Moreover, the modality of payment for the services provided by the employee\nand the contractor typically differs. The employee is to receive wage (i.e. regular\n[mainly periodical] payment) while the contractor is to receive remuneration in\nthe amount of price of service to be paid mainly through lump sum payment or\nin instalments. Any ways, the main task at this level is to show that there are similarities and\ndifferences between these relationships. Pin pointing the differences enable us to\ndemarcate the scope of application of employment law. Employment law applies\nonly on employer-employee relations and not on the others. Principal-agent\nrelationship and client-contractor relationships are civil or commercial contracts\nto which employment law does not apply.

    "text": "35\nGeneral Introductory Remark\nPART I\nTHE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP\n36\nChapter II\nContracts of Employment\n2.1. General\nBroadly, employment relations can be categorized into two types. These are\nindividual employment relation and collective employment relations. These\nrelations reflect the nature and interests of the social partners in industrial\nrelations. As it is well known, in a production process, there are tasks which are\nto be performed individually; and there are tasks assigned to employees\ncollectively as a group as well. These modalities of discharging workplace tasks\nbring about multiple rights, duties and interests. The rights and interests manifest\nthemselves in individual and collective forms. In this chapter, we will examine\nthe individual ones and the collective aspects will be handled at a later part in\nthis text. Indeed, individual contracts of employment through which an\nemployer and employee engage each other and determine their respective rights\nand obligations is the basis for the employment relationship. 2.2. Definition\nFor the purpose of the private sector employment regime (under the Labour\nProclamation) a contract of employment is defined as follows. A contract of employment shall be deemed formed where a natural\nperson agrees directly or indirectly to perform work for and under the\nauthority of an employer for a definite or indefinite period or piece of\nwork in consideration for wage (Article 4(1) of Labour Proclamation\nNo.1156/2019). It must be borne in mind that first and foremost employment relations are\nbasically contractual relations. It is a special contract to provide service in return\nfor wages. Thus, the general principles of the law of contract apply to this\nrelationship. Hence, issues such as capacity, legality, possibility and formality are\n37\nContract of Employment\nrelevant to the relationship. It is only when employment law comes up with its\nown special principles different from the general principles of contract that the\napplication general of contract law principles would be avoided. In that case, the\nprinciple that the special prevails over the general applies. For instance, to enter into a valid contract, the general principle of contract,\namong other things, requires that the contracting parties should be capable of\ncontracting. Capability is usually associated with attainment of the age of\nmajority. For the purpose of Ethiopian law, majority is attained at the age of\neighteen. Thus, based on the general principles of contract law a valid contract is\nto be entered into upon attainment of eighteen years.",

    "text": "However, employment law\nhas deviated from this general principle by allowing persons to enter into an\nemployment contract upon reaching the age of fifteen (Article 89(2). Hence, the\nlatter prevails for employment law purposes. Definitional elements of a contract of employment\na) Agreement\nThe source for employment relation is an agreement of the parties; and hence it\nis a wilful engagement. This excludes forced labour from the ambit of\nemployment relations. Slavery and tenancy do not depend on agreement. Someone would find oneself in the status of being a slave or a tenant regardless\nof their agreements or will. Therefore, unlike slavery and tenancy, employment\nrelations are consensual relationships that puts the parties on formal equality. The manner of expressing agreement could be direct or indirect. For instance, a\nperson may directly and personally sit and bargain with their employer and\nconclude a contract of employment thereafter. The other possibility is public or\nprivate employment agencies may serve as intermediaries between the parties in\nthe form of “matching of offers.” Thus, the agreement may be expressed directly\nor indirectly through employment agencies. 38\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAdmittedly, there are two types of employment agency tasks recognized by law. The first type of agency is not a party to the contract. Its role is limited to posting\nof vacancies and selecting potential candidates while the actual contract is\nconcluded directly with the service user. The second type of agency enters in to\na contract in its own name with the employee. In the latter case the agency itself\nis the employer of the employee concerned. Therefore, it is for the former case\nthat the phrase “indirectly through employment agencies” refers to. b) For the performance of work (provision of service)\nThe other element under the definition is, the commitment from the side of the\nemployee is to “perform work” for the benefit of the employer. This makes an\nemployment contract a contract of service since performing work is an aspect of\nthe provision of service. In fact, the service expected from the employee is a\npersonal service. Although an employee may express her agreement indirectly,\nher service is to be provided personally. It is the skills and the work discipline of\nthe specific employee which is of interest to the employer.

    "text": "Unlike a contractor who can delegate unless provided otherwise, employment is\na service of personal nature. Similarly, unlike a contract of sale of object where the seller delivers a tangible\nobject to the buyer, the employee is making her services (i.e. something\nintangible) available to the benefit of the employer. The nature of the service\ncould be physical and/or intellectual in content. Through this arrangement, the\nemployee is putting her skill and working capacity at the disposal of the\nemployer. Hence, it is important to note that behind this personal service there\nexists human dignity which makes the relationship unique and “de-\ncommodified.” 39\nContract of Employment\nc) Under the authority of the employer\nThe service to be rendered by the employee which is also for the benefit of the\nemployer is to be provided under the authority of the employer. Working under\nthe authority of the employer is one of the distinguishing factors between a\ncontractor and an employee. Both the contractor and the employee render\nservice for the benefit of their counter parts (i.e. client and employer\nrespectively). But the contractor performs such service “under its own\nresponsibility” in the sense that he is not under the strict guidance and control of\nthe client. The client, under this arrangement, is interested on the attainment of\na given result and not on the manner of how the result was achieved. In relation to this, the Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division entertained the\ncase between Addis General Hospital and Dr. Misrak Tilahun (File No.101396;\nVol.17). Dr. Misrak was a licensed radiologist who had provided service to the\nhospital for two hours every day. He worked for some years under this\narrangement. When his contract was terminated by the hospital, he took his case\nto court in order to obtain compensation and other entitlements associated with\nunlawful termination of a contract of employment. The hospital, among other things, contended that the plaintiff was a duly licensed\nprofessional who worked for only two hours per day under his own professional\nresponsibility. Hence, the hospital had no full authority and supervisory power\nover him. Thus, argued the Hospital, the relationship is not governed by the\nlabour law. However, the lower courts held that the relationship between the\nparties was employer and employee relationship; the termination was unlawful\nand award compensation to the plaintiff. Finally, the hospital took its case to the attention of the Cassation Division.",

An employee is expected to render her service “under the authority of the\nemployer”. Some ILO literatures try to differentiate these categories by using\nthe phrases “dependent worker” (employee) and “independent worker”\n(contractor). In a sense, the employee is dependent on the employer. This implies,\nas noted earlier, the employer is not only interested on the result but rather on\nthe manner of achieving the result as well. It means the employer will have the\npower to determine what to be done; when to be done; where to be done; how\nto be done; and with whom to be done. In any case, where someone has authority over another, the relationship will be\na vertical one rather than horizontal. It is one of superior-subordinate\nrelationship under which the employer will have the prerogative to instruct the\nemployee (allocating work-load); to supervise whether the employee complied\nwith such instruction; and to discipline (including dismissal) if and when its\ninstruction is not observed. In effect, the employer is conferred with the power\n“to command and control” an employee. It is important to note, however, that the authority granted to the employer over\nthe employee is not an absolute master and servant type. As the relationship\nbetween the parties is based on a contract, it is within the framework of the terms\nof the contract that the scope of authority of the employer over the employee\nwill be determined. d) Length of employment\nAs regards to the length of engagement of the parties, there are three possibilities\nof determining this issue. It may be determined from the perspective of a set\namount of time, in which case it would be a fixed term employment. There may\nalso be task-based determination in the sense that the engagement will come to\nan end upon completion of the task assigned to the employee.",

Therefore, a contract of employment could be entered into for a definite\nperiod; for piece work or for indefinite period. In fact, as we shall see later in this\ntext, even the contract of employment for a definite period may not be\nterminated upon the expiry of the specified period if the job is of continuous\nnature. As we all know marriage, in principle, is a life-long engagement. This is\nnot the case for employment relation. There is no as such life-long contract of\nemployment. e) Wage\nFinally, among the definitional elements for a contract of employment is wage. As the employee is committing herself to render personal service for the benefit\nand under the authority of the employer, the employer will have a corresponding\nduty to discharge. It will be required to pay wages to the employee. Employment\nrelations are not a pro bono (free service) service. On the contrary, it is a service\nin return for wages. As we shall see later in this text, Ethiopia has no minimum\nstatutory wage for the private sector employment regime. Thus, the amount of\nwage is an agreed sum by the parties though the level of agreement may not be\non equal footing. Due to economic supremacy, the employer may dictate its own\nterms in this regard. Be that as it may, for purposes of this law “wage” is defined as a regular payment\nto which an employee is entitled in return for the performance of the work that\nhe performs under a contract of employment (Article 53(1). The mode of\npayment for wage could be in cash or in kind though in modern world almost all\npayments are to be effected mainly in cash. As regards to the mode of determination, it could be on hourly, daily, weekly, bi-\nmonthly etc. basis or it could be outcome based (piece rate) mode of payment. What makes it wage is its regularity rather than its periodicity. It means wages\nare not necessarily periodical payments. Owing to this broad definition of wages,\npiece rate payment which is not a periodical payment (but still a regular payment)\nis an aspect of wage determination. The fact that an employee is paid on daily\n42\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nbasis or on piece rate does not deny her an employee status.",

Usman Ali (File No.105555; Vol.17),\nthe Cassation Division was asked to determine whether a person who was paid\non piece rate basis was in fact an employee. The facts of the case were: an\nindividual (deceased) whose dependents were the applicants in this case was\ngunned down by unknown assailants while driving between Addis Ababa and\nDire Dawa. The applicants instituted an action for dependents’ benefit due to\nemployment injury of the deceased. The deceased was paid Birr 800 for each trip\nfrom Dire Dawa to Addis Ababa.

Herein below is an extract from ILO (2003) “The Scope of the employment\nrelationship” International Labour Conference: 91st Session 2003. The determination of the existence of an employment relationship should be\nguided by the facts of what was actually agreed and performed by the parties,\nand not by the name they have given to their contract. That is why the\n43\nContract of Employment\nexistence of an employment relationship depends on certain objective\nconditions being met (the form in which the worker and the employer have\nestablished their respective positions, rights and obligations, and actual\nservices to be provided), and not how either or both of the parties describe the\nrelationship. This is known in law as the principle of the primacy of fact, which\nis explicitly enshrined in some national legal systems. This principle might also\nbe applied by judges in the absence of an express rule.

    "text": "These include compliance\nwith the employer’s instructions; being at the employer’s disposal; socio-\neconomic inequality between the parties and the worker’s economic\ndependency. In common law countries, judges base their rulings on certain\ntests developed by case law, for example “control test”, “integration test” and\n“economic reality test” and “mutuality of obligation test”. In all systems, the\njudge must normally decide on the basis of the facts, irrespective of how the\nparties construe or describe a given contractual relationship. Notes:\nIn practice, differentiating employer-employee relationships and client-\ncontractor relationship is difficult. All the same, differentiating them is\ncrucial as it determines the applicable legal framework. Employment law\napplies to the former and civil or commercial law applies to the latter. Confronted with such a problem, courts have crafted indicators that are\nhelpful in determining the relationship. Some of them are the following:\n­ The control test: the extent of control one of the parties has over the\nother. The stricter the controlling power one of the parties has over the\nother, it is more likely that the relationship is employer-employee\nrelationship than client-contractor. ­ Who provides working tools? is also an important parameter. If the party\nis committed to report for duty with his own working tools, it is likely\n44\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nthat he is a contractor than an employee. In fact, even under the Labour\nLaw, “… to provide implements and materials necessary for the\nperformance of the work is the primary duty of the employer unless\notherwise provided in the contract of employment” (Article 12(1)(b). In\nprinciple, the employee is expected to report for duty merely in fit\nphysical and mental condition. Working tools and raw materials are to\nbe made available by the employer. ­ Who pays tax? The administration of tax liability is helpful in\ndetermining the relationship as well. If in their contract, the service\nprovider is to pay income tax by his own, it is highly likely that the party\nis a contractor; whereas if the service recipient is empowered to deduct\ntax due at payroll, it is highly likely that the other party is an employee. ­ Integration test: If the job position of the party is within the core\nbusiness of the enterprise, it is highly likely that the person is an\nemployee.",

Relatively speaking, client-contractor relationships are meant for\nshorter duration. ­ Personal nature of the service: If the service provider has the right to\ndelegate its service provision under the arrangement, it is highly likely\nthat the relationship is client-contractor relationship. An employee is\nexpected and required to render the agreed service in person. ­ Mode of payment: more often than not, in employer-employee\nrelationships, wages are determined on a periodical basis.

Form of Contract of Employment\nNow that we have spelt out the definitional elements of a contract of\nemployment, let us see how they should be expressed in order to obtain legal\nvalidity. The relevant provision provides as follows:\nUnless otherwise provided by law, a contract of employment shall not\nbe subject to any special form (Article 5; Labour Proclamation). Pursuant to this stipulation, the general principle is that a contract of\nemployment does not require any special form. It can be created orally, by\nconduct or in any means so long as the parties have attained the so called\n“meeting of minds”. In fact, this is more or less identical with the principle of the\nlaw of contract which stipulates that unless otherwise provided, no special form\nshall be required and a contract shall be valid where the parties agree (Article\n1719(1); Civil Code).",

    "text": "In practice employees may feel insecure in their employment whenever their\nemployers fail to give them written instrument as to their status as employees. Their fear emanates from the fact that if and when a dispute arises with an\nemployer, employees will not have evidence to show that they indeed had an\n46\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nemployment contract. Some unscrupulous employers may, they hold the view\nthat they can avoid employer’s liability if they deny any written evidence\nshowing contractual relation with the employees. Both views, however, are misconceptions. For the purposes of the law, the\nexistence of employment relations can be proved by any means such as witnesses,\nemployee ID cards or payroll sheets. A written contract of employment is not a\nmandatory requirement except for exceptional cases. This does not mean that\nwritten contracts are irrelevant. Written instrument are generally more durable\nand reliable in resolving possible disputes at a later stage. Thus, the law\nencourages the parties to make their agreement in writing and to be signed by\nthe parties. For the purposes of the law, written contract of employment can be achieved in\neither of the two ways. These are: a contract of employment or a letter of\nemployment. If the parties managed to reduce their agreement into writing that\nis well and good. However, though the law does not mandatorily require a\ncontract of employment to be made in writing, it requires the employer to issue\na letter of employment within 15 days from the conclusion of the [unwritten]\ncontract which should be delivered to the employee (Article 7(1). If such letter\nis not partly or wholly objected to by the employee within 15 days of receipt, it\nshall be deemed that a contract of employment is concluded between the worker\nand the employer (Article 7(2). In a sense, it seems that the contractual principle\nfor pre-existing relationships which states that silence amounts to acceptance\napplies in this regard. At any rate, it means, the legal preference is that there\nshould be a written instrument evidencing their engagement. There is also another element to note in this regard. It is important to underline\nthat the law does not say a contract of employment does not require a particular\nform. It rather states that, “unless otherwise provided by law…” a contract of\nemployment does not require to be made in writing.",

For instance, Article\n47\nContract of Employment\n11(3) prescribes that when the parties agree to have probation period, the\nagreement shall be made in writing. Moreover, where the parties to an\nemployment contract agree to terminate their relationship, such an agreement\nshall be binding on the employee if and only if it is made in writing (Article 25(2).

Express exclusion\nAs noted earlier, the Labour Proclamation has expressly excluded its application\nto certain employment relations. The most important ones which are frequently\nlitigated before courts and labour tribunals are the following:\n- \nManagerial employees\nWho are managerial employees? How do we distinguish managerial employees\nfrom non-managerial ones? Why are managerial employees excluded from the\nambit of the Labour Proclamation? What protections, if any, would they have? In order to determine who managerial employees are, Ethiopian legal system\nadopted two approaches at different periods; namely structural and functional\napproaches. Structural approach of distinction focuses on the organizational\nstructure of the enterprise. For instance, the Labour Relations Proclamation\nNo.210/1963 employed a combination of structural and functional approaches. It\ndefined managerial employees as “a manager, director, superintendent or\nrepresentative of an employer or a person performing similar duties on behalf of\nan employer” (Article 2(f)(i) of Proc. No.210/1963). Under this definition, persons\ndesignated as a manager, director or superintendent, regardless of their actual\nfunctions, (structural) were categorized as managerial employees and any other\n49\nContract of Employment\nemployees performing similar functions (functional) were considered as\nmanagerial employees as well. Conversely, Labour Proclamation No.64/1975, the proclamation under the Derg\nregime, followed solely the structural approach. Under this approach, managerial\nemployees in an enterprise are the Manager or the deputy manager of an\nundertaking or any of its branches and all those officials accountable to the\nManager or the deputy manager (Article 2(27)(g). Therefore, in this approach,\nthe answer to the question who is a managerial employee will be deduced by\nlooking at the organizational structure of the undertaking. If within the organizational structure of the enterprise, an employee is\naccountable to either the Manager or the deputy manager, regardless of the\nnature of her job functions, the individual will be categorized as a member of the\nmanagement staff. This approach, though easier to identify and cheaper to\nadminister, has the risk of associating employees who do not perform genuine\nmanagerial functions with the management team. The functional approach, which has been incorporated in our labour\nproclamations since 1993 focuses on the function of the employee rather than on\nthe title (form) assumed, or the position where the employee is situated within\nthe organizational structure of the enterprise concerned.",

    "text": "If her job tasks are\naspects of managerial functions, she will be part of the management team, if not,\nregardless of her job title in the organizational structure of the company she will\nbe treated as an ordinary employee. Hence, it is the content (function) not the\nform (name) that matters. Whereas structural approach relies on the\norganizational chart of the undertaking, the functional approach focusses on the\njob description of the concerned employee. The Cassation Division in Southern\nNations and Nationalities Housing Development Enterprise v. Yohannes Bizuneh\n(File No.117076; Vol.19), reviewed the job description of an employee to\ndetermine whether the person was a managerial employee or not. The next issue is, what are managerial functions? In order to avoid heterogeneous\nunderstanding of the concept, the labour law has already but indirectly defined\n50\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nwhat managerial functions are. Accordingly, Article 2(10) has provided the\nfollowing definition:\n“Managerial employee” means an employee who, by law or delegation of the\nemployer, is vested with powers to lay down and execute managerial policies,\nand depending on the type of activities of the undertaking, with or without the\naforementioned powers an employee who is vested with the power to hire,\ntransfer, suspend, layoff, dismiss or assign employees, and includes a legal service\nhead who recommend measures to be taken by the employer regarding such\nmanagerial issues, using his independent judgment, in the interest of the\nemployer. Thus, an employee would be categorized in to management team if the worker\nby law or employer’s delegation, is engaged in decision making task in any or\nmany of the following activities:\n­ \nlaying down and executing management policies;\n­ \nhiring and firing employees;\n­ \npromotion and demotion of employees;\n­ \ndismiss, suspend, transfer and layoff of employees;\n­ \nLegal Service Head. It is assumed that these measures are to be undertaken in the name, on behalf and\nfor the benefit of the enterprise (employer). Thus, these positions are to be\noccupied by people who have gained the confidence of the employer. In a sense,\nthese job positions are “services of trust.” After all, managerial employees are\nstationed at the workplace to protect the interest of the employer. Any employee\nwho undertakes these functions associates herself with the employer rather than\nwith the employees.",

If managerial\nstaff is to be covered by the Labour Proclamation, the employer will not have full\npower of terminating them whenever its confidence over them is eroded because\ngrounds of termination of employees are narrowly formulated out of which all\nterminations are held unlawful thereby entitling the terminated employee in\nmany instances to reinstatement. This approach will compel employers to be\nrepresented by a personnel team on whom they have no or little confidence. This\nwill have undesirable consequences from the perspective of employers’ interests. Thus exclusion is justified in this regard as well. In fact, in connection with freedom of association, ILO jurisprudence recognizes\nthe validity of the exclusion of managerial employees from joining trade unions\nfor the employees. In this regard the Committee on Freedom of Association\nstipulates that\nit is not necessarily incompatible with the requirements of Article 2 of\nConvention No.87 to deny managerial or supervisory employees the\nright to belong to the same trade unions as other workers, on condition\nthat two requirements are met: first, that such workers have the right\nto form their own associations to defend their interests and, second, that\nthe categories of such staff are not defined so broadly as to weaken the\norganizations of other workers in the enterprise or branch of activity\nby depriving them of a substantial proportion of their present or\npotential membership. Moreover, this distinction between managerial and non-managerial employees\nappears to be also appropriate in order to avoid “divided loyalty” of the\nmanagerial staff. On the one hand, the job position of managerial staff requires\nthem to ensure and protect the interests of the employer. On the other hand, if\nthey unionize themselves with the non-managerial labour force, they may be\ninclined to ensure and protect the interest of the workers. This will put them in\nan ambivalent position. As a result, exclusion seems the appropriate policy\nresponse in this regard. After all, as many of the managerial employees are skilful\n52\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nand are technocrats, they may have the strength to bargain in a manner that best\nserves their interests.",

    "text": "Given all these reasons, there may not be a serious injustice\nin excluding the managerial employees from the protection of the Labour\nProclamation. In principle, an employee who merely limited himself to offering\nrecommendations to the management staff without making any decision is\ncategorized as a non-managerial employee. However, there is an exception to this\nrule where a legal service head of an enterprise though they may be confined to\nproviding recommendations are still categorized by law as a member of the\nmanagement staff. This position of the law may be debatable, but it seems a policy\ndecision. At this juncture a legitimate issue may be flagged up. If managerial employees are\nexcluded from the applicability of the Labour Proclamation, what safeguard\nwould they have? First, their contracts of employment will be the main basis for\ntheir protection. Second, since the Civil Code applies to all employment relations,\nincluding managerial employees, the relevant provisions of the Civil Code may\nbe of some help in protecting the rights managerial employees. In fact, in this\nregard, the Cassation Division in Nib Transport Share Company v. Ato Tegenu\nMeshehsa case (File No.18307; Vol.2) and Wegagen Bank v. Ato Anagaw\nGebeyehu (File No. 130685; Vol.21) held similar view. Nevertheless, it is ruled\nthat if the managerial employee and the employer agree to regulate their\nrelationship by the provisions of the Labour Proclamation; or a work rule\nprovides for the applicability of certain provisions of the Labour Proclamation,\nthis should be given effect (Ambaye Weldemariam v. Ethiopian Cereal Trading\nEnterprises; File No.60489: Vol.13)\n- \nEmployees of private [personal] service\nFurther exclusion is applied on “contracts of personal service” (Article 3(2)(d). Pursuant to Article 2(16) the Labour Proclamation “Employment of private\nservice” means an employment for a non-profit purpose such as catering,\n53\nContract of Employment\ncleaning, guardianship, guarding, gardening, driving and other related services\nfor the employer and his family’s consumption. These are domestic services and\nthe employees working in them are “domestic workers”. Ordinarily, the relationship between a domestic worker and their employers\nsquarely fits into the definitional elements of a contract of employment. Nevertheless, this relationship has been excluded from the applicability of the\nLabour Proclamation. But it must be noted that it is not all cooking, cleaning, guarding or gardening\nservices which are excluded from the ambit of the Labour Proclamation.",

    "text": "If such\nservices are provided to a profit-making employer, such as hotels or restaurants,\nthe relationship will be governed by the Labour Proclamation. Therefore, it is\nnot the nature of the service that matters. It is rather the identity of the employer\n(whether for profit or for non-profit employer) that is the determining factor in\nthis regard. Domestic employees are under-paid and over-worked suggesting that protection\nis warranted. In fact, it has, more often than not, gender dimension in the sense\nthat women have wider visibility in this sector of employment. Thus, it is\nlegitimate to raise a question as to why domestic workers are denied the\nprotection of the Labour Proclamation. Some tend to contend that employer and\ndomestic worker relationship is too private and too personal for regulation. Nevertheless, the fallacy in this contention is that husband and wife relationship\nis equally private and personal (if not more personal) but a substantial part of the\nrelationship is regulated by family laws. It may, however, be that since this is\nhousehold issue; and since every household has its own unique feature, labour\nstandardization by law at household level would be unfeasible. Another possible reason could be private persons who hire domestic workers for\npersonal service purposes will be willing to buy such service as long as its price is\nwithin their economic ability to pay. Whenever labour law protection is accorded\nto domestic workers, obviously the price of their labour would be higher because\nprotection involves cost. Thus, private persons would be compelled (priced-out)\n54\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nto change their consumption pattern (working it by themselves) thereby quit\nbuying this service. This might have an adverse effect of reducing the\nemployability of domestic workers. Hence their coverage by the Labour\nProclamation would backfire in the sense that protection by the law would be to\ntheir disadvantage and they would be better off if they are excluded from the\nambit of protection. In fact, in some jurisdictions, their labour laws do not apply not only in not-for-\nprofit entities but in employees of the informal economic sector as well. Employees of the informal economy are persons engaged in a business enterprise\nthat is not required to have a license, is not required to keep a book of accounts\nand employs less than ten workers. However, the Ethiopian labour law does not\nhave that kind of flexibility.",

    "text": "The law is rigid in the sense that it is applicable on\nan employer that even employs a single worker. Employer is defined as “a person\nor an undertaking that employs one or more natural persons…” (Article 2(1). It\nis also irrelevant for the purpose of the Ethiopian Labour Law whether the entity\nhas a trade license or not; or whether it has book of accounts or not. These are\nissues which may be relevant for the ministries of Trade and Revenue\nrespectively and not to the Ministry of Labour and Skills. Be that as it may, an important point at this level is, though domestic workers are\nexcluded from the ambit of the Labour Proclamation, the Labour Proclamation\nhas stipulated that the Council of Ministers shall issue Regulations governing\nconditions of work applicable to personal service (Article 3 (3)(c). However, even\nthough this promise has been in place since the adoption of Labour Proclamation\nof 1993, the Council of Ministers has not acted upon it yet. As a last resort\ntherefore, domestic workers have very minimal protection under the Civil Code\nof 1960 (Articles 2601-2604) other than their respective contracts of\nemployment. 55\nContract of Employment\nProblem for discussion:\n1. We have already seen that employees who render domestic service are\nexcluded from the coverage of the Labour Proclamation. But what if\nthe job position of the employee requires him to undertake “mixed\nservice” which combines domestic service and business service? Should he be categorized as domestic worker or employee under the\nlabour law? For instance, let us assume Tessema has a garage in which\nEshetu is employed as a driver. In his capacity as a driver, Eshetu’s job\ndescription includes transporting employees of the garage to and from\nwork place. In addition to this, he is required to transport Tessema’s\nchildren to their schools and back home. He transports Tessema’s wife\ntwice a week for shopping to their household as well. In this scenario\nEshetu has been engaged in a mixed service. Now the issue is whether\nEshetu is a domestic worker or an employee of the garage. Discuss\namong yourselves and come up with possible solutions. 2. The Ethiopian government did not yet provide adequate regulatory\nframe work of protection for domestic workers locally, as it had\nexpressly excluded them from the applicability of the Labour\nProclamation. On the other hand, the government is trying to regulate\nthe employment relations of domestic workers to be deployed to\nmiddle-east countries. What is your view?",

    "text": "Did you observe any\ninconsistency in this approach? - \nPublic servants\nAnother employment relation excluded from the Labour Proclamation is\n“contracts relating to members of the armed force, members of the police force,\nemployees of state administration, judges of courts of law, prosecutors and others\nwhose employment relationship is governed by special laws” (Article 3(2)(e). As\n56\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nit is a well-known, the state has three main branches. These are the legislative,\nthe executive and the judiciary. Their appointed officials and employees who are\ngenerally called “public servants” are outside of the coverage of the Labour\nProclamation. In fact, ministers and judges are not, strictly speaking, employees because they\ndo not fill their respective posts through employment. They are rather politically\nappointed. Therefore their tenure, rights and responsibilities are to be\ndetermined through the political channel. Even the experts and support staff\nworking thereunder, though technically employees, are not governed by the\nLabour Proclamation. Their working relationships are rather subject matters of\nthe Federal Civil Service Proclamation. The same is true with respect to armed\nforces and the Police that have their own special laws. It is interesting to note, however, that it is not all employees of the state which\nare excluded from the application of the Labour Proclamation. It is only\n“employees of state administration” which are excluded from the labour law’s\napplication. This will lead us to inquire whether there is a distinction between\n“employees of state” and “employees of state administration”. “Employee of the state” is a broad concept which comprises of employees of state\nadministration and employees of state-owned enterprises. When the state acts as\na public power with regulatory and administrative decision making functions, it\nis considered to have engaged in state administration. Conversely, when the state\nowns and runs business, for all practical purposes, it will be treated like any\nbusiness entity since it has a profit and business purpose in view. In the latter\ncapacity it no longer is a state administration. What are excluded from the\napplicability of the Labour Proclamation are employees of state administration. Therefore, employees of state-owned enterprises are to be governed by the\nLabour Proclamation. 57\nContract of Employment\nProblem for discussion:\nHow do we distinguish state administration from state owned enterprises?

    "text": "Ethiopia Civil Aviation Authority from Ethiopia Airlines? Telecommunication Agency from Telecommunication Corporation? In this connection there is another issue which deserves a separate treatment. There are employees of the state which may not fall within the two categories\nindicated above. For instance, employees of public educational facilities and\nhealth facilities do not fall in the above categories because the public educational\nand health facilities are neither state administration nor state owned enterprises. They are not state administration because they do not possess any regulatory and\nsupervisory power. Nor are they state-owned enterprises because they do not\noperate on a for-profit basis. Strictly speaking therefore, employees of these\npublic social service providers are not excluded from the ambit of the Labour\nProclamation. Nevertheless, the Federal Civil Servants Proclamation No. 1064/2017 defines “civil servant” as a person [permanently] employed by a federal\ngovernment institution (Article 2(1). And “Government institution” means any\nfederal government office established as an autonomous entity by a proclamation\nor regulations and financed by government budget (Article 2(3). These public social service providers, for instance, the public universities are\nestablished by Council of Ministers regulations and they are financed by the\ngovernment. Hence, they satisfy the definitional elements of government\ninstitution. Therefore, their permanent staff employees are civil servants. However, the academic staff in Ethiopian universities are employed on a fixed\nterm contract basis to be renewed every two years. Strictly speaking they are not\npermanent employees. Thus what is the employment of status university\ninstructors? For the purpose of the Civil Servants’ Proclamation “temporary\n58\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nemployee” is defined as “a person employed in a government institution for a job\nwhich is not permanent in nature or where circumstances require temporarily\nassigned to a permanent position…” (Article 2(2); emphasis added). Clearly, the\nservice of an academic staff in public universities that is teaching, research and\ncommunity services are permanent in nature as they are the institution’s core\nfunctions. Therefore, though they are fixed term employees; they are, by virtue\nof their tasks, permanent employees of the government institutions and hence\ncivil servants. Based on this analysis, the public educational and health facilities\nare government institutions and employees working thereunder are civil\nservants. Thus, though they are not employees of state administration, because of\nthe broad formulation of the federal civil servants’ law, they are to be governed\nby the Civil Servants Proclamation.",

Conditional exclusion\nAnother mechanism of exclusion formulated by the Labour Proclamation is\nconditional exclusion in the sense that the law stipulates conditions the\nfulfilment of which will result in exclusion. Unless and until the conditions\nstipulated are satisfied, the contract of employment under consideration shall\nremain within the coverage of the Labour Proclamation. The relevant provision\nstates as follows:\nArticle 3(3);\n(a) Unless the Council of Ministers by regulation decides, or an\ninternational agreement to which Ethiopia is a signatory provides\notherwise, employment relations between Ethiopian nationals and\nforeign diplomatic missions or international organizations operating\nwith in the territory of Ethiopia shall be governed by this\nProclamation. 59\nContract of Employment\n(b) The Council of Ministers by Regulation determine the inapplicability\nof the Proclamation to employment relations established by religious\nor charitable organizations. Generally, these are employment relations in non-profit sector. Diplomatic\nmissions, international organizations, religious organizations, and charitable\norganizations are all non-profits. This is an indication that though the Labour\nProclamation is mainly intended to regulate the for profit sector, it can reach out\nto non-profit enterprises, if not excluded. The modality of excluding the\napplicability of the law may be undertaken by either international agreement or\nby regulations. Let us review them one by one:\n- \nEmployees of diplomatic missions and international organizations\nIt is well known that many foreign diplomatic missions and international\norganizations have been operating in Ethiopia. As a seat of the African Union, it\nis believed that the number of such diplomatic missions and international\norganizations will be on the rise over-time. These institutions employ Ethiopians\nas local staff in various job positions. How the local staffs’ employment\nrelationship with the diplomatic missions is to be regulated is something to\nconsider. In this regard, the Labour Proclamation offers two options of exclusion in the\nabsence of which the Labour Proclamation regulates the relationship. The first\noption is to enter in to an international agreement between the Ethiopian\ngovernment and the diplomatic missions or international organizations as to how\nthe employees are to be regulated. The second option is for the Council of\nMinisters to issue regulations on the matter. The Council of Ministers has not issued any such regulation yet. In practice it is\nthe first option that has been materialized.",

    "text": "As gathered from personnel at the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, whenever diplomatic missions or international\norganizations commence operation in Ethiopia, they sign “Host Country\n60\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAgreements” with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This instrument stipulates\ntheir rights, duties, privileges and immunities while operating in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, based on the agreements, they are duty bound to respect Ethiopian\nlaws. This implies they are required to comply with the stipulations of the Labour\nLaw in their employment relations. However, whenever a labour dispute arises between the missions and any of their\nlocal employees, we are told by the relevant authorities that, efforts for amicable\nsettlements through the assistance of the Protocol Department at the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs will be undertaken. Therefore, the immunity accorded to these\ninstitutions is not to disregard the provisions of the Labour Proclamation. They\nare rather given exemption from appearing before Ethiopian labour tribunals. This approach tries to strike the balance between two competing interests. These\nare respecting the sovereign power of the representatives of the foreign countries\nfrom being dragged into domestic institutions such as courts on the one hand;\nand protecting the fundamental rights of host country citizens on the other. - \nEmployees of religious and charitable organizations\nThe other category under the so called “conditional exclusion” is the situation of\nemployees of religious and charitable organizations. For this category too, as we\nindicated above, the Council of Ministers has been delegated to issue Regulations\nwhich determine the inapplicability of the Labour Proclamation to employment\nrelations in these institutions. This implies in the absence of the anticipated\nRegulations their employment relations shall be governed by the Labour\nProclamation. Although this authorization was given to the Council of Ministers through the\nLabour Proclamation of 1993, it did not act upon it until recently. However, in\n2015 a Council of Ministers regulation was issued to this effect. This is a “Council\nof Ministers Regulation on Employment Relations established by Religious and\nCharitable Organizations No. 342/2015.” According to the Regulation, it is stated\nthat “the Labour Proclamation shall not be applicable with respect to a person\n61\nContract of Employment\nwho gives spiritual service in a religious organization” (Article 3(1).

    "text": "In fact, prior to the adoption of this Regulation, the Federal Supreme Court\nCassation Division had already held that employees of religious institutions who\noffer spiritual service are not subjects of the Labour Proclamation, they are rather\nto be governed by the religious code of the respective institutions (Hamerework\nKidist Mariam Church v. Diacon Mihret Birhan et al.; File No.18419: Vol.8);\n(Hohetesemay Saint Mary Church v. Diacon Ayalew Addisu; File No.47806:\nVol.9). Based on the holdings of the Cassation Division, if the labour law is made\nto apply on such employment relations, it will be tantamount to interference by\nthe government in religious affairs which is constitutionally prohibited (Article\n11(3) of the Constitution). Thus, the Regulation is predominantly an\nendorsement of the holding of the Cassation Division. In another note, the Labour Proclamation is applicable with respect to workers\nengaged in performing   administrative, charity or income generating activities\nundertaken by religious organizations (Article 3(3) of the Regulation). Nevertheless, workers engaged in performing administrative or charity activities\nin religious organizations are not entitled to collective bargaining. Therefore, in\norder to determine the full applicability of the Labour Proclamation with respect\nto employees of religious institutions, it depends on whether the particular job\nposition of the employee is an income generating or not because it for workers\nengaged in income generating activities in religious institutions that the Labour\nProclamation in its full force applies. With respect to employees of charitable organizations as well, the Regulation\nstipulated that “the Labour Proclamation is applicable with respect to workers\nengaged in performing income generating, administrative or charity activities in\na charitable organization” (Article 4). It is only with respect to collective\nbargaining that the applicability of the Labour Proclamation has been avoided in\n62\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nconnection with employees engaged in administrative and charity activities\nwithin the charitable organizations. The relevant part of the Regulation prescribes as follows: Religious and\ncharitable organizations shall not be obliged to engage in collective bargaining\non increment of wages, benefits, incentives and other similar matters with\nworkers engaged in performing administrative or charity activities” (Article 5(1). The implicit message of this provision is that employees of religious or charitable\norganizations tasked with income generating activities still can engage in\ncollective bargaining. 2.5.

It is to be noted\nthat in the Ethiopian legal parlance, the Amharic version is the governing version\nin case of inconsistency between the Amharic and the English versions.

On the principle that the special prevails over the general, it is their special\ngoverning legislation which applies on them. Thus, the exclusion was\nunnecessary to their cases, too. The other phrase defined by this proclamation is “temporary employees”. Pursuant to Article 2(2) of the Proclamation, “temporary employee” means a\nperson employed in a government institution for a job which is not permanent\nin nature or where circumstances so require temporarily assigned to a permanent\nposition provided however, that it shall not include the following:\na) Persons employed as daily labourers and paid on daily basis;\nb) Persons assigned in a government institution for apprenticeship or\ninternship;\nc) Persons who enter into contract with a government institution to work\nfor consideration and on the basis of their own business or professional\nresponsibility;\nd) Persons who enter into contract with a government institution to work\nfor consideration on part-time basis due to their special knowledge and\nskill;\nAs regards to the scope of application of the Proclamation, Article 4 of the same\nprovides that it shall be applicable to all offices and employees falling under\ndefinitions of “government institutions” and “Civil Servants.” Therefore,\ntemporary employees, daily labourers, independent contractors and part-timers\nare outside of the coverage of this Proclamation because they are not permanent\nemployees. The Civil Service Agency is empowered to issue directives as regards\nto them. As to the recruitment and deployment procedure of civil servants, it is more\ncompetitive and open compared to the Labour Proclamation recruitment\n65\nContract of Employment\nprocedure.",

    "text": "For instance, if a\ncertain labourer is employed to harvest crops in a particular season of the year, as\nsoon as the harvesting is completed, the contract of employment may validly be\nterminated without any complicated process. Project work has such attributes. The construction sector is very much associated with this kind peculiar\narrangement. In a certain case submitted to the Cassation Division Ethiopian\nTelecommunication Corporation v. Gebissa Yemane (File No. 20885; Vol.4), an\nemployee was hired to prepare meal for trainees, it was held that his termination\nis valid as soon as the trainees completed their training. Problem for discussion:\nPlease come up with your own examples that can fall under any of the\nsub-Articles above. To have a better understanding of this issue, you are\nadvised to read the Cassation Division decision on Ethiopian\nTelecommunication Corporation v. Tiegist Worku (File No.11924; Vol.3)\n67\nContract of Employment\n2.6.2. Contract for specified period (fixed term employment)\nA contract of employment could also be concluded for a definite duration. For\nexample, the parties may state that their contract of employment shall remain\nvalid for six months, one year, two years etc. Conventionally, it may be said that\nafter the expiry of the specific duration, the contract of employment shall come\nto an end. However, it is not as simple as that. In fact, this is one of the\ncontroversial areas under Ethiopian Labour Proclamation because the Law has\nexhaustively listed certain situations where fixed term employment may be\nformulated (Article 10). In all other cases “the presumption of indefiniteness” of\na contract of employment applies (Article 9). This means unless the nature of the\ncontract falls under any of the circumstances stipulated under Article 10, even if\nthe contract fixes a duration, the contract is presumed to have been concluded\nfor indefinite duration. This is one of the areas of labour contract which deviates from the general\nprinciple of contract that states terms of contract agreed by the parties are binding\nas though they are law. Although the parties agreed to a fixed term engagement,\nthe law overrides their terms and extends it to an indefinite duration. It seems\nthat it is with the view to providing employment stability to the weaker party\n(the employee) that this presumption has been put in place. Therefore, even if\nthe contract is for a definite period, if the job is of a continuous nature, the\nemployer may be compelled to renew the contract.",

    "text": "The Cassation Division\nrendered a similar interpretation under Ethiopian Telecommunication\nCorporation v. Tiegist Worku (File No.11924; Vol: 3). In connection with fixed term employees, it is important to note that they are\nentitled to all benefits and protections under the Labour Proclamation because\nthe law prohibits discrimination among employees based on status unless the law\nhas created its own distinction. In a certain case, Yotek Contruction Plc v. Gebre\nBelayneh et al (File No. 87338; Vol.15), the Cassation Division handed down a\ndecision that substantiates this line of argument. On the other hand, where the\nsource of the benefit is an instrument other than the law such as a collective\nagreement, the Cassation Division held that benefits available to indefinite period\n68\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nemployees may not be available to fixed term employees (Ethiopian Electric\nPower Corporation v. Seyum Gebretsadik et al; File No.47469; Vol:9)\nIn practice, however, there are instances where employers deny annual leave,\nmaternity leave or other similar entitlements alleging that fixed term employees\nor contract employees are not eligible for such entitlements. Similarly, many\ntrade unions deny union membership to fixed term employees based on a similar\ncontention. As far as the law is concerned, however, such discriminatory\nmeasures are legally invalid. Therefore, all employees, regardless of whether they\nare permanent or temporary are equally entitled to all benefits and protections\nunder the law. Of course, there are some instances where differential treatment\nis allowed by law. For instance, probationary employees are not entitled to sick\nleave or severance payment because the law states that in order to be eligible for\nthese entitlements, completion of probation period is a pre-requisite (please refer\nArticles 39(1), 85(1). 2.6.3. Contract for indefinite period\nA contract for definite period, as indicated above, is mainly associated with\nproject works which have limited period of existence. Where enterprises are\nestablished for indefinite duration, their modality of employment is mainly for\nindefinite period as well. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the employee is\nemployed forever or for life. An employment contract, unlike marriage, is not a\nlifelong commitment. Moreover, the labour law does not provide an absolute\nguarantee of employment. It thus does not mean permanent employment; it\nrather only means the employee concerned is protected from arbitrary dismissal. In this connection, in the world of practice, there are two misconceptions both\nfrom the employers’ and employees’ side.",

    "text": "From the employer’s side, some\nemployers tend to conclude fixed term arrangements while the job position is of\npermanent nature. The reason for so doing is they hold the view that in a fixed\nterm arrangement they have wider latitude for hiring and firing such employees\nincluding offering reduced labour standards. 69\nContract of Employment\nFrom the employees’ side too, whenever they conclude fixed term contract even\nfor jobs of permanent position, they feel insecure in their employment in that\nthey are of the view that the employer may terminate them at will upon the\nexpiry of the stipulated period. At times, they resort to court with a view to\nobtaining a declaration of permanency in their employment status since their\nposition is of permanent nature. Both positions are legally invalid. With regard to the positions of the employers,\nthough it is within the principle of contractual freedom to enter into fixed term\ncontracts if the parties wish, it will be unlawful to terminate a contract of\nemployment by the mere fact that the duration expires. The presumption of\nindefiniteness (Article 9) prohibits such a measure. Of course, the Cassation\nDivision in Lalibela Mar Museum v. Marie Beza case (File No.138054; Vol.21)\nheld that a contract for definite period can validly be terminated upon the expiry\nof the stipulated period. However, the Cassation Division’s holding in this regard\nis open to challenge on the face of Article 24 (1) of the Labour Proclamation and\nthe spirit of the labour law in general. The new labour proclamation tried to clarify the confusion by amending the\nphrasing of Article 24(1). ( Please, compare the formulation of Article 24(1) under\nProclamation No.377/2003; and the same sub-Article under Proclamation\nNo.1156/2019 and decide for yourself). Thus, the employer should look for other\nvalid grounds of termination such as incompetence or serious improper conduct\nif the job is of a continuos nature. Moreover, the employer can in no way reduce\nthe benefits to be accorded to the employee by law due to his contractual status. Therefore, fixed term employment does not offer employers a wider employers’\nprerogative. With respect to the employees’ concerns, courts are not there to declare what the\nlaw has already stated. Courts are mainly there to resolve disputes and render\njudgments. Thus, if the employees can show that they were denied entitlements\nby the employer alleging that they are fixed term employees, they can seek\nremedy before court of law.",

In this connection, the Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division, under\nEthiopian Telecommunication Corporation v. Genta Gemea; File No.16273: Vol.2\nheld that “if an employee’s sole request is to determine his contractual status or\nto amend definite contract of employment into indefinite one, he will not have a\ncause of action that requires court determination because this has already been\ndetermined by the law; and it does not need court blessing. Hence, such request\nshall not be entertained by courts or other labour tribunals.” Moreover, if they\ncan show that their job position is of continuous nature, the employer cannot\nterminate them by the mere fact that the fixed term period expires. 2.7. Rights and Duties of the Parties\n2.7.1. Obligations of the employer\nIn the process of concluding a contract of employment, the parties are expected\nto spell out their respective rights and obligations under the contract\nexhaustively. However, the law provides mandatory provisions from which the\nparties may not deviate unless the law expressly allow them to contract out. Thus,\nwhat has been provided by the law shall be implied terms of the contract. In this\nregard, Articles 12-14 of the Labour Proclamation are the pertinent ones. Article\n12 stipulates the positive obligations of the employer, while Article 13 stipulates\nthat of the employee. Article 14 provides negative obligations both for the\nemployer and the employee. While Article 14(1) prescribes what prohibited acts\nare for the employer; sub-Article (2) of the same provision provides unlawful acts\nfrom the side of the employee. It may be advisable to elucidate some of these prescriptions. Pursuant to Article\n12 of the labour proclamation, the employer shall provide work to the worker in\naccordance with the contract of employment (Article 12(1)(a)). It has been\n71\nContract of Employment\nfurther obligated to pay the worker wages and other benefits in accordance with\nthis proclamation or the collective agreement (Article 12(2). At this juncture, it may be legitimate to ask the question as to why should the\nlaw obligate the employer to provide work so long as it pays him the wage. Wouldn’t the duty to pay wage be sufficient? Why should the law bother itself\nin prescribing the duty to provide work on the employer?",

    "text": "Some reasons could be submitted. First, in cases where wage is assessed in the\nform of piece rate, failure to provide work may result in denial of wage because\nif the employee is not given job, she will not produce anything. In fact, under the\nCivil Code there has been a provision to this effect. Article 2529(1) provides “the\nemployee who is paid at piece rates may require the employer who engages him\nto give him an adequate amount of work for the duration of the contract”. The\nfact that the employee is entitled “to require adequate amount of work” implies\nthe employer has the duty to provide work in such cases. Therefore, for piece rate\nbased wages, providing adequate work should be an essential duty of the\nemployer. The other reason is based on human rights concerns. It is believed that work is a\nsource of pleasure and very much associated with respect to human dignity. Work has essential psychological functions such as personal fulfilment and self-\nexpression, opportunities for social interaction, sense of status and prestige. As a\nresult, denying someone work is tantamount to dispossessing one’s career\ndevelopment. Thus, with the introduction of a human rights based approach to\nlabour, provision of work to the employees, regardless of the modality of the pay\nstructure, has been included as a primary duty of the employer. The work that is expected to be provided is “in accordance with the contract of\nemployment.” This formulation restricts the power of the employer towards\nassigning the employee in reference to the agreed job position. In fact, under\nlabour proclamation No.64/1975, it was provided that “a worker shall not be\nforced to perform a job which is not stipulated in the contract of employment”\n(Article 10(1). This “to the letters of the contract” approach restricted employers\n72\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nfrom organizing and re-organizing production process and assigning and re-\nassigning tasks to their employees as they saw it fit. Of course, under certain very restricted conditions (for example if the employee\nis suspected of grave misconduct, the employee may be suspended from duty\npending investigation) the employer can unilaterally declare suspension and\nthereby is exempted from the duty to provide work (Article 27(4).",

    "text": "Indeed, the\nCassation Division held that it is within an employer’s prerogative to assign its\nemployee in any tasks so long as the employee’s job grade and other benefits are\nnot reduced (Muger Cement Enterprise v. Hailu Mengistu; File No.40938; Vol:8\nand Menbere Patriarch Supreme Office v. Yibeltal Atnafu; File No.44033; Vol.8). The other employer’s duty which is payment of wages and other benefits is a\nfairly obvious one because the employee is rendering service in the expectation\nof and in return for such entitlements. Payments other than wages may be such\nas allowances, over-time payment and bonus. The legal basis for such\nentitlements could be contracts of employment, work rules, collective agreement\nbecause Ethiopian law does not yet fix statutory minimum wage for the private\nsector. Nevertheless, if the amount of wage is not fixed in the contract, and is\nnot based on collective agreement, the wages which is usually paid for certain\nwork in a certain branch or region is due (Civil Code; Article 2535). To respect the human dignity of the employee is another duty imposed on the\nemployer (Article 12(4). We have discussed on the historical development of\nemployment relationships that individuals have passed through the status of\nslavery, serfdom and tenancy which were undignified treatment in many\nrespects. With the transformation of social relations from status to contract and\ndecommodification of labour, however, the concern for human dignity received\nprominence. The Ethiopian Constitution prohibits inhuman treatment of any sort in any area\nof social life. Specifically, it provided that “no one shall be held in slavery or\nservitude”; and “no one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour”\n(Article 18(2) and (3). Thus, respect for human dignity has received constitutional\n73\nContract of Employment\nprotection as well. Moreover, the Labour Proclamation has made it unlawful for\nan employer “to compel any worker to execute any task which is hazardous to\nhis life” (Article 14(1) (e); and “to coerce a worker in any manner to work or\ndischarge an obligation” (Article 14(1) (j) both of which are contrary to human\ndignity. 2.7.2. Obligations of the employee\nThe employee has corresponding obligations as well. She is expected to render\nthe agreed service in person (Article 13(1). She is not, as of right, entitled to\ndelegate someone on her behalf to offer the service.",

    "text": "As the employee is expected\nto render the service under the authority of the employer, the duty to obey the\ninstructions of the employer is another aspect of the engagement (Article 13(2). However, the employee is never obliged to carry out work if this would violate\nthe law. This means the employee has the duty to obey lawful orders. The duty\nof care and diligence in handling all equipment and tools entrusted to her (Article\n13(3); and reporting for duty in fit mental and physical condition are other\nessential duties of the employee (Article 13(4). Nevertheless, other than spelling out these mandatory obligations, the law did\nnot expressly attach any sanctions in case of failure to comply with these dictates. A legitimate question therefore is, what the consequences would be. One possible\nline of argument would be since grounds of termination without notice have been\nexhaustively listed under Article 27(1), and since these are not mentioned\nthereunder, they cannot be grounds of dismissal. They could entail any\ndisciplinary measure short of dismissal. The other possible argument would be, since these are mandatory provisions,\nfailure to abide by them amounts to striking at the root of the contract thereby\nresulting in frustrating the terms of the very contract. This latter position has\nbeen reinforced since the Cassation Division has handed down similar line of\ninterpretation in many instances (Fitsum Astatike v.

In this connection,\nthere are times when employees have objected to comply with work rules\nalleging that such rules violated their privacy or presumption of innocence. For\ninstance, where employers establish search at the gate during employees’\nchecking in and out of the work premises, certain employees have objected to\nthis practice on the contention that such measures would violate their\nconstitutional right to privacy.",

    "text": "Notes:\nAs far as literature is concerned, however, it is argued that “for a search to\nviolate the constitutional right to privacy, the employee who has been\nsearched must have a subjective expectation of privacy which could be\nconsidered reasonable by society. Rules relating to the doctrine of\nexpectation of privacy do not operate within a vacuum. Reasonable\nexpectation of reasonable people, factors including location, nature of\nobjects or data and many other factors must be considered.” Similarly, in the Stedman v. UK case which was submitted before the\nEuropean Commission on Human Rights, the applicant was asked by her\nemployer to accept a contractual variation which would require her to work\non Sundays. She refused to accept the variation because it interfered with\nher religious obligations. The European Commission on Human Rights\nrejected her case as manifestly inadmissible. The Commission refused to acknowledge any connection between her\nrefusal to work on Sundays and her religious beliefs, holding that she had\n75\nContract of Employment\nbeen dismissed for failing to agree to work certain hours rather than for her\nreligious belief as such. Moreover, the Commission emphasised she was free\nto resign and seek alternative employment which did not involve Sunday\nworking. Problem for discussion:\n1. Does search at the gate of working premises violate constitutional right\nto privacy? 2. What about dress codes in which employers prescribe wearing of\nuniforms or other dressing formalities? Particularly, imagine the\nuniform is prepared in a manner that appears to contradict with one’s\nreligious ways of dressing, does it violate freedom of religion? 3. What legitimate business purpose do search and dress code serve, if any? Discuss. Another mode of stipulating duties of the parties has been formulated by\nprescribing negative obligations. Article 14(1) prescribes the negative duties for\nthe employer, while 14(2) is the negative duties of the employee. Discrimination\nin general and gender and anti-union discrimination in particular along with\ntaking retaliatory measures against an employee are prohibited acts for the\nemployer.",

Historically, in labour literature, employers have been criticized for taking\nretaliatory measures against employees by the mere fact that the latter attempted\nto exercise their rights such as instituting court action against the employer. Moreover, discriminatory payment among employees based on sex had been\nwidely practised. In fact, discriminating against employees based on race, sex,\nreligion or political opinion had been common.

It is rather to give more focus\nand emphasis that the Labour Proclamation has reproduced many of the\nprovisions of the conventions almost verbatim. One of them is discrimination. In\nEthiopian labour history, protection against discrimination was first introduced\nthrough Labour Relations Proclamation of 1963. However, its protection was not\ncomprehensive in the sense it focused only on anti-union discrimination (Article\n30). 77\nContract of Employment\nArticle 1(a) of Convention No. 111 defines discrimination as “any distinction,\nexclusion or preference [based on certain grounds] which has the effect of\nnullifying or impairing equality of opportunities or treatment in employment or\noccupation”.",

    "text": "This purely descriptive definition contains three elements:\n­ a factual element (the existence of a distinction, exclusion or preference\noriginating in an act or omission) which constitutes a difference in treatment;\n­ a ground on which the difference in treatment is based; and\n­ the objective result of this difference in treatment (the nullification or\nimpairment of equality of opportunity or treatment). Through this broad definition, the instrument covers all the situations which\nmay affect the equality of opportunity and treatment that they are to promote. Most national legislations contain essentially these same elements, using the same\nterms as the Convention. Prohibited distinctions are enumerated along with the\nfields in which the prohibition applies. The legislation specifies that any\ndifference in treatment based on prohibited grounds and applying to one of the\nfields enumerated, a priori constitutes discrimination. Any discrimination - in law or in practice, direct or indirect - falls within the\nscope of the instrument. General standards that establish distinctions based on\nprohibited grounds constitute discrimination in law. The specific attitude of a\npublic authority or a private individual that treats unequally persons or members\nof a group on a prohibited ground constitutes discrimination in practice. Indirect discrimination refers to apparently neutral situations, regulations or\npractices which in fact result in unequal treatment of persons with certain\ncharacteristics. It occurs when the same condition, treatment or criterion is\napplied to everyone, but results in a disproportionately harsh impact on some\npersons on the basis of the characteristics such as race, sex religion or political\noutlook and is not closely related to the inherent requirements of the job. It is\n78\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nnow universally recognized that discrimination based on such grounds is\ncontrary to the concept of fairness and human dignity. Equality in Employment and Occupation: International Labour Conference 83rd\nSession (1996)\nIt is important to note that not all distinctions, exclusions or preferences in\nemployment and occupation are deemed to be discrimination. Convention\nNo.111 set aside three categories of measures which “shall not be deemed to be\ndiscrimination: those based on the inherent requirements of a particular job;\nthose warranted by the protection of the security of state; and those measures of\nprotection and assistance.” Under Article 1(2) of Convention No.111, “any distinction, exclusion or\npreference in respect of a particular job based on the inherent requirements\nthereof shall not be deemed to be discrimination.” This exception must be\ninterpreted restrictively.",

    "text": "When qualifications are required for a particular job, it\nmay not be simple to distinguish between what does and what does not constitute\ndiscrimination. It is often difficult to draw the line between bona fide\nrequirements for a job and the use of certain criteria to exclude certain categories\nof workers. In order to determine the real scope of this exception, the following\ntwo points should be examined: first, the concept of “a particular job” and second,\nthe definition of “inherent requirements” of a particular job. It appears that from the preparatory work of the Convention that the concept of\na “particular job” refers to a specific and definable job, function or task. The\nnecessary qualifications may be defined as those required by the characteristics\nof the particular job, in proportion to its inherent requirements. A qualification\nmay be brought to bear as an inherent requirement without coming into conflict\nwith the principle of equality. In no circumstances, however, may the same\nqualification be required for an entire sector of activity. Likewise, the general\nexclusion of certain jobs or occupations, such as work in agriculture, or public\n79\nContract of Employment\nservice from the scope of measures designed to promote the principle of equality\nof opportunity and treatment is obviously contrary to the Convention. As regards to men and women, distinctions on the basis of sex may be required\nfor certain jobs, such as those in performing arts or which are perceived as\ninvolving particular physical intimacy; such a distinction may also be linked to\nspecial protection measures. These distinctions should be determined on an\nobjective basis and should take account of individual capacities. However, the\ncontinuing exclusion of women from certain posts of authority merely because\nthey are women encounter negative prejudices is one of the measures to be\neliminated by methods appropriate to national conditions and practice. With regard to religion, national provisions can be found restricting jobs\nassociated with a particular religion to persons of that religion. Provisions of this\nkind are generally deemed not to be discriminatory; however, this exclusion does\nnot apply to all work performed for a religious organization (such as building\nmaintenance, etc.). In order to fall within the scope of the exception provided for\nin Article 1(2) these criteria must correspond in a concrete and objective way to\nthe inherent requirements of a given job or occupation. From the employee’s perspective as well, there are prohibited acts. Article 14(2)\nof the Labour Proclamation has spelt out some of them.",

Triangular Employment Relationship\nIn a standard employment relationship, the relationship is bilateral. If at all third\nparties were involved, they were confined to “services for matching offers.” Through passage of time, however, disputes concerning the legal nature of a\nrelationship for a provision of labour are increasingly frequent because the\nemployment relationship may be objectively ambiguous or disguised. Both\nsituations create uncertainty as to the scope of the law and can nullify its\nprotection. One source of such complication is the emergence and proliferation\nof the so called “triangular employment relationship.” Under this arrangement,\nworkers are employed by an enterprise (the “service provider”) that perform\nwork for a third party (the “user enterprise”) to whom their employer provides\nservices. The fact that they are employees might not be in doubt but they\nfrequently face difficulties in establishing who their employer is, what their\nrights are and who is responsible for them. In most cases, the triangular arrangement was justified on efficiency grounds in\nthe sense that enterprises consider that they would be more efficient if they were\nto focus on their core business and outsource their support service to be handled\nby other service providers.",

    "text": "At times, it was put in use by service users in order to\n81\nContract of Employment\navoid employers’ legal obligations associated with employment relationships. Whatever the motive, it has been widely practised even in Ethiopia. Particularly,\nmany of the private security service and cleaning services have been contracted\nout (out-sourced) to independent service providers instead of offering them in-\nhouse. However, this arrangement has been unpopular within the labour\ncommunity. For one thing, it has the effect of displacing labour force as employees who were\nperforming the outsourced task will be liable to reduction. Secondly, employees\nof the service providers felt that the service providers are taking undue advantage\nat their expense in such an arrangement. They are unclear as to who their\nemployer is; and unsure against whom they should bring an action to enforce\ntheir rights under the law. Ethiopia ratified the Private Employment Agencies\nConvention, 1997 (No.181) in 1999. The Convention obligated its signatories to\nmake sure that rights of employees of the private employment agencies have been\nrespected. Moreover, it has been expressly stipulated that “private employment\nagencies shall not charge directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any fees or\ncosts to workers” (Article 7(1). Herein below is an extract from: “The Impact of Triangular Relationship on\nWorkers’ Right in Ethiopia” LL.M thesis by Nigatu Abera (AAU-College of Law\nand Governance-2019): Footnotes omitted. Although there is no consensus on what exactly constitutes a standard\nemployment relation, in most labour law regimes, it is characterized by a full\ntime, permanent employment contract, of an employee working for a single\nemployer at a time, on the latter’s premises and expected to continue doing so for\nundetermined period of time. In other words, an employment relationship is\nconsidered to be standard (typical) when there is an exchange of labour in return\nfor wages on a full time basis according to a known schedule; the employee works\ncontinuously for one employer with one contract instead of series of contracts;\n82\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nand work at a place provided, according to a schedule determined and direction\ngiven by the employer. A triangular employment relationship is a relationship in which employees find\nthemselves interacting with two (or more) persons, each of whom assumes\ncertain functions of an employer in standard employment relation.",

    "text": "Under\nstandard employment relationship, the employee enters into a contract with a\ncertain person and provides the labour service for the same person (who is the\nemployer and the user of the labour service at the same time). In a triangular\nlabour relationship however, this is not the case. The worker enters into an\nemployment contract with a certain person assuming the place of employer (the\nemployment agency) while the actual service is rendered to another person who\nis not part of the contract (the user enterprise). The relationship between the employment agency, the client and the worker is\nthe most common form of what is known as “triangular” or “tripartite”\nemployment relationship. A basic problem raised in such relationships is who\nshould be considered the legal “employer” of the worker in question. In these\nsituations, there is no contract directly signed between the user enterprise and\nthe worker. However, there is reason to place some employer responsibilities\nwith the user, since the characteristics of employment that put workers in need\nof protection can be found, to some extent, in both of the worker’s relationships\n(i.e. worker-agency and worker-user relationships). So, responsibility of an\nemployer is shared between the two parties (i.e. the user enterprise and the\nemployment agency). This arrangement which is the result of an attempt to externalize employment\nrelationships by user enterprises may take place in the forms of outsourcing,\nsubcontracting or use of temporary employment agency service. Outsourcing as\na modality of externalizing work, is an arrangement whereby an activity or\nservice performed by employees within an employer’s business (usually a “non-\ncore” or ancillary service) is contracted out to be performed by an outside party. The outsourcer will take over the complete function of a particular department,\n83\nContract of Employment\nrather than the user enterprise employing full time personnel. Outsourcing in\nrelation to labour may take place in different forms. An enterprise may outsource\nthe task of recruitment and placement of workers who are engaged in activities\nwhich do not constitute the core business. In such cases the entity to which this\ntask is outsourced will perform the work without having any further relation\nwith the workers recruited and placed at the outsourcing enterprise. There is\nnothing that looks triangular here. A survey by Susan N. Houseman has revealed some of the reasons invoked by\nemployers for using non-standard labour relations.",

As discussed elsewhere in this paper, the reasons on\nemployees’ side for engaging in the atypical labour relationships are of two types. Some employees prefer this arrangement due to their particular situation (like\nfamily and other responsibilities) which do not allow them work in the standard\narrangement. Others join work under these arrangements because they do not\nhave other alternatives. Generally, despite the change in the world of work which is witnessing a\nproliferation of atypical employment relation at a higher rate, the focus of labour\nlaws in most countries is the standard labour relation. This is attributable to the\nvery inception of labour laws which mainly consider the full time, permanent\nwork arrangements and did not sufficiently cover atypical work arrangements. The relatively younger age of some of the atypical workers have also partly\ncontributed to this. However, due the unique features involved in the\nrelationships, workers in the non-standard employment relation might be\nsubjected to abuse unless this work is regulated properly.",

    "text": "*******************************************************************\nArticle 2(13) of the labour law defines “Private employment agency” as any\nlegally licensed person, to provide one or two of the following local employment\nservices without charging directly or indirectly any fee from the worker:\na) Local employment exchange service without being a party to an\nemployment relation; or\nb) Deploying of employees under its authority to the service of a service user\nenterprise, by entering into contract of employments with such\nemployees; or combines both services. It is in the case of (b) that the issue of triangular employment relationship will\ncome into the picture. In the former case, the private employment agency is\nmerely serving as an intermediary rather than assuming the role of an employer. 85\nContract of Employment\nBut under scenario (b) the agency is deploying the employees under its authority\nthereby making it an employer. It is on the latter case that the service recipient\nwould be exonerated from employer’s liability as the service provider is at the\ntime an employer. Incidentally, it is worth noting that Employment Exchange Service Proclamation\nNo.632/2009 had an important provision that would have been helpful in\nallocating responsibility between the service provider and the user enterprise\nwith respect to the employees. It provided as follows:\nThe private employment agency and the third party [user enterprise]\nshall jointly and severally liable for violation of the contract of\nemployment concluded with a worker to provide the service mentioned\nin sub-Article 1(b) of Article 2 of this Proclamation (emphasis added)\nArticle 22). What is mentioned under sub-Article 1(b) of Article 2 of the Proclamation relates\nto offering of services by making workers available to a third party by concluding\na contract of employment with such workers. However, since Proclamation\nNo.632/2009 is repealed by Proclamation No.1156/2019, the concept of joint and\nseveral liability has been withdrawn. Now that the latter proclamation has\nempowered the Minister to issue directive on conditions for private employment\nagency to participate in local employment service (Article 171(1)(k), it is hoped\nthat the Ministry would re-introduce the joint and several responsibility\nprinciple that may be of some help to alleviate the concerns of the labour\ncommunity. 2.9.",

Some of the reasons could generally be:\n­ \nvoluntary arrangement of the parties;\n­ \nreasons dictated by societal interest;\n­ \ndue to reasons beyond the control of the parties. In the Ethiopian context, Article 18 of the Labour Proclamation lists down these\ngrounds. Article 18: Grounds of Suspension\nThe following shall be valid grounds for the suspension in accordance with\nArticle 17 of this proclamation:\n1) Leave without pay granted by the employer upon request by the worker;\n2) Leave of absence for the purpose of holding office in trade unions or other\nsocial services;\n3) Detention for a period not exceeding 30 days provided, however, that the\nemployer is notified within 10 days or is supposed to know of the detention;\n4) National call;\n5) Full or partial suspension, due to force majeure, of activities of the employer\nfor a period of not less than 10 consecutive days;\n6) Financial problems, not attributed to the fault of the employer, that\nrequires the suspension of the employer for not less than 10 consecutive\ndays;\nAlthough there is also what is called “disciplinary suspension” where an\nemployee may be suspended from duty and wage pending investigation on\n87\nContract of Employment\nalleged serious misbehaviour, we believe that this is not its proper place to discuss\nthe issue.

Conversely, the employee will not be\nrequired to render service for the employer.

On the one\nhand, it enables the employee to obtain modest increases in payment for some\ntime without losing his employment security. From the employer’s perspective,\nsuch an arrangement helps it retain skilled and productive employees by\nproviding employment flexibility that addresses its employees’ concerns and\ninterests. - \nSuspension for socially beneficial tasks (Article 18(2) and (4)\nIt is possible that employees may assume trade union leadership offices which\nmay demand much of their working time. Usually, trade union leadership at an\nenterprise level is a part-time job in the sense that the employee renders such\nservice mainly out of working hours.

In such cases what will be the fate of the employee’s contract of employment? Should it be terminated?

On the one hand, employees would like to make sure that they will get their\nemployment back after discharging their social responsibility. Otherwise, they\nmay not be willing to commit themselves to such services. From the employer’s\nperspective as well, it would like to make sure that it will not be obligated to pay\nwages to the employee while the latter was not rendering service to it.

Of course, the detention cannot be classified in any of the leaves, such\nas sick leave, maternity leave, mourning leave etc. The Proclamation does not\nrecognize “detention leave.” Strictly speaking therefore the employee will be\nexposed to dismissal due to unjustified absence from duty. However, it must be noted that detention is within police power and hence it is\nbeyond the control of the employee. Detention per se does not erode the\npresumption of innocence. It is when a conviction attaches that presumption of\ninnocence would be removed. Conviction is judicial determination while\ndetention is not. It thus appears that Article 18(3) is an exception to Article\n27(1)(b).

Be that as it may, most of the grounds of suspension under these provisions are\nsituations associated mainly with economic reasons or other reasons beyond the\ncontrol of the parties. For example, the Metehara Sugar Factory may be\ncompelled to temporary suspend its operations fully or partially, for more than\nten days, due to the over flow of the Awash River out of its river banks. This may\nbe one incident where suspension may be associated with non-economic reasons\n91\nContract of Employment\nbeyond the control of the employer. An enterprise’s financial problems or\nshortage of raw materials may also be a ground for temporary cessation of\noperations. For instance, there have been multiple times in Ethiopia when\nconstruction enterprises had to temporarily cease operation, for more than ten\ndays, due to shortage of cement or iron bars. These have been typical cases of\nsuspension. Suspension under these two grounds is not within the sole discretion of the\nemployer. It is subject to review by the MOLSA or Regional Labour and Social\nBureaus. In order for the appropriate government office to determine whether\nthe stated reason is adequate to suspend operation temporarily or not, the\nemployer should notify in writing the appropriate office within three working\ndays of the occurrence of the alleged ground of suspension (Article 19). The\nreason for such an arrangement seems if the measure is left to the discretion of\nthe employer, it is feared that it may give room for misuse of the provisions for\nnot well-founded reasons. It is the responsibility of the Regional Labor Offices to\nhandle the request. The appropriate government office is expected to determine whether or not there\nis sufficient ground for suspension within three working days after the receipt of\nthe notification. In fact, failure to respond by the appropriate organ within the\nprescribed period shall be considered as acceptance of the suspension measure\n(Article 20(1)). Where the appropriate office determines there is sufficient\nground for suspension, it will approve it and fix the duration for it. But the\nduration shall not exceed ninety days (Article 21(1)). Where the appropriate\norgan is convinced that the employer cannot resume operation within the\nmaximum period of ninety days, the contract of employment shall be put to an\nend and the workers shall be entitled to benefits specified under Articles 39 and\n44 of the Proclamation (Article 21(2).",

    "text": "Broadly, lawful grounds of termination of contract of employment are the\nfollowing:\n­ termination by the operation of law;\n­ termination by the agreement of the parties;\n­ termination at the initiation of the employer;\n­ termination at the initiation of the employee;\nLet us examine them in closer detail hereunder:\n3.1.1. Termination by the operation of the law\nUnder this provision, the occurrence of a certain factual or legal situation will\nput to an end the parties’ contractual relationship without any additional\nprocedure or process. For instance, if a contract of employment was concluded\nfor the performance a specific work, the completion of the agreed work will bring\nan end to the parties’ engagement (Article 24(1). Prior notice or any other\nmeasure is not required from either party in such cases. This is not the case if the contract was made for a definite period. If a contract of\nemployment was made for a definite period, the expiry of the stipulated period\ndoes not necessarily bring the contractual relation to an end because Article 9\n95\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nplaces what we call a “presumption of indefiniteness” of a contract of\nemployment. It means if the job to which the employee has been assigned is of a\ncontinuous nature, unless the employee was employed for replacement purposes,\neven if the contract was for a definite period and the period has expired, renewal\nshall be required unless there existed other ground of termination such as\nincompetence or serious misbehaviour. Death of an employee is another ground for termination of a contract of\nemployment by the operation of law (Article 24(2). This is a natural consequence\nof a contract of employment because the employee is required to render the\nagreed service personally. If the employee dies, personal service is no longer\navailable. The right to employment is personal and cannot be inherited by third\nparties. It is true that under the general principles of contract, the heirs of a\nperson shall be substituted for him in contracts to which he was a party, unless\nthe contrary was stipulated or flows from the nature of the contract (underline\nadded: Article 1986; Civil Code). In employment contract cases, since the nature\nof the contract requires personal service that service provision is not transferable\nto heirs. An employee’s attainment of the age of retirement as per the relevant law could\nalso be another ground of termination under this section.",

    "text": "There is an inter-\ngenerational equity policy consideration that would note that older workers\nshould vacate job positions to the youth. There was no retirement age for the\nprivate sector in Ethiopia until 2011. During the Imperial era retirement age for\nthe public sector was attainment of sixty years of age for men and fifty-five years\nfor women. At the time of the military rule, attainment of fifty-five years for men\nand women was the pensionable age. The post-military regime increased the\nretirement age to sixty for men and women. All the same, the labour\nproclamation does not prescribe retirement age in any of its provisions. It is with the coming into effect of Proclamation No.715/2011(as amended by\nProclamation No.1267/2014) (i.e. Private Organizations Employees’ Pension\nProclamation) that the private sector has been introduced into pension schemes. 96\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAccording to the Pension Proclamation, attainment of sixty years of age for both\nsexes is the retirement age. However, it must be noted that in a country like\nEthiopia where registration at birth is not yet implemented, verifying actual age\nis difficult, if not impossible. Problem for discussion:\n1) Is attainment of sixty years of age too early or too late for retirement\nin the Ethiopian context? 2) With respect to the Ethiopian pension laws on retirement age of the\nthree successive regimes in Ethiopia, what is your view? What policy\nconsiderations, if any, should be put in place while fixing retirement\nage? 3) Where registration at birth is not yet implemented, on what\nmechanisms should implementing agencies rely on to effectively put\npension at in place? The other situation which may result in termination by the operation of the law\nis, where the enterprise ceases operation permanently due to bankruptcy or for\nany other cause (Article 24(4). This may be considered as the “death of the\nenterprise.” Admittedly, bankruptcy in business, though not desired, is a\npossibility. Enterprises may be driven out of the market by other more efficient\npeers. Technically, bankruptcy could be analogized to the death of the enterprise\nand it has equivalent effect to the death of the employee. However, it is not the\nemployer who determines bankruptcy; it is rather a court of law that declares\nsuch a status. It must be noted that mere reduction of profitability does not\namount to bankruptcy. Reduction of profitability is something that will handled\nunder Article 28(3).",

    "text": "97\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nIndeed, it is not only bankruptcy which is covered under this sub-Article. Any\nother cause, for instance, if an operating license of an enterprise is revoked\n(where the revocation is permanent) by pertinent authorities, may be a valid\nground for termination. It should be recalled that where the cessation of\noperation is temporary, it is valid a ground for suspension. However, where the\ncessation of operation is a permanent one it will be an issue of termination of\nemployment relationship. How to determine permanency has been proposed in\nthe previous chapter. As noted there, the maximum duration for suspension due\nto force majeure or financial reasons is ninety days. Therefore, it is reasonable to\nconsider suspension of operation beyond ninety days as permanent cessation of\noperation. In this connection, the Cassation Division in Wudmetas Nuro import-export\nenterprise v. Hunegnaw Setie and et al; (File No.42985; Vol: 9) held that\nemployees terminated due to permanent cessation of operation of the enterprise\nare entitled to payment in lieu of notice period. The court relied on the provisions\nof Article 28(3). It seems to me that Article 28(3) is relevant in cases of reduction\nof labour force. In reduction of labour force situations, there will be two groups\nof employees; those who will be retained and those who will be terminated. Those to be reduced would be eligible for notice period as per Article 35(1) (d). In the case before the Cassation Division, however, as the enterprise ceased\noperation permanently, the whole labour force was terminated. Thus it is my\nview that Article 24(4) would have been more appropriate than the provision\ncited by the Cassation Division. Since Article 24(4) is placed under termination\nby the operation of the law, and hence employees terminated thereunder are not\nentitled to notice. Thus, payment in lieu of notice period was unwarranted in the\ncircumstances. Finally, another ground of termination by virtue of the law is when the worker\nis unable to work due to partial or total permanent incapacity (Article 24(5). This\nis more or less similar with our discussion in death cases. Since personal service\n98\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nof the employee is required, if the employee is proved unable to render service\ndue to permanent incapacity, there seems no need to require the parties remain\nengaged. Hence, the contract of employment will be terminated automatically.",

    "text": "However, the subjective appreciation of the employer that the employee is\nunable to work due to permanent incapacity is not sufficient. Whether the\nemployee is within permanent incapacity must be verified by medical experts. This rigorous third party verification requirement may be noted from the\nAmharic version of the law (ሲረጋገጥ) though it is not clearly spelt out in the\nEnglish version. Legally, it is noted that the Amharic version is the prevailing\nversion. In fact, Article 39(1) (g) seems to cross-refer to this sub-Article; and the\nrequirement of verification by medical board has been expressly stated therein. 3.1.2. Termination by agreement of the parties\nIt was stated at the beginning of the previous chapter that the basis for a contract\nof employment is the agreement of the parties. It logically flows that the\nagreement of the parties could put an end to their contractual relationship as well. Nevertheless, the Labour Proclamation places a rigorous procedure during\ntermination compared to the time of contracting. Recall that at the time of\nentering into employment relationship, the law, in principle, does not require\nany formality. The parties may enter into their commitment in writing or orally. But at the time of termination by agreement, the agreement to terminate must be\nmade in writing and signed by the parties (Article 25(2). In fact, even though the Labour Proclamation does not require the signature of\ntwo witnesses, the Civil Code has such a requirement for written contracts\n(Article 1719; Civil Code). A contract of employment being a special contract, it\nhas to comply with the requirements of the general law of contract principles\nunless expressly excluded. If these formalities are not complied with, the\nemployee can challenge the agreement as invalid at a later stage. Such rigorous procedure of consensual termination seems to be dictated by the\nneed to ensure the employment stability of the employee. The assumption of the\n99\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nlaw seems that if the employee affixes signature to the written instrument of\ntermination, it is a well-considered decision from the worker’s side. More often\nthan not, written instruments tend to show due consideration and seriousness of\ncommitment. In Kaliti Metal Production Enterprise v. Birhanu Lidet Wolde (File\nNo.37575; Vol.8), the Cassation Division ruled that an agreement to terminate a\ncontract of employment that is not made in writing is invalid and hence unlawful\ntermination. 3.1.3.",

    "text": "Termination at the initiation of the employer (dismissal)\nThe traditional rules governing the contract of employment which\ndeveloped in various countries during the nineteenth century were\ncharacterized by a formal symmetry of the rights of either party to\nterminate the contract of employment, by giving notice, without even\nhaving to justify its decision. However, the consequences of this\nequivalence of rights differed widely for the parties: termination of the\ncontract by the worker-exercising his fundamental right to protect his\nfreedom of work is in most cases merely an inconvenience for the\nemployer, while the termination of the contract of employment by the\nemployer could result in insecurity and poverty for the worker and his\nfamily, particularly during periods of massive unemployment. The\ndisparity of the consequences of each exercising its discretionary power\nto terminate the employment relationship led in many countries to a\nmovement towards workers’ protection. The development resulted in an\nextension of the period of notice; the payment of severance allowance;\nefforts to restrict the employer’s discretionary power to terminate the\nemployment relationship for any reason or without reason by applying\nthe concept of the abusive exercise of a right and abusive termination of\nthe employment relationship; and more recently, the adoption of\nprovisions requiring justification for the termination of the contract of\nemployment by the employer as the employment situation became more\ndifficult. These provisions were supplemented by measures to be applied\n100\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nin the event of workforce reductions for economic, technological,\nstructural or similar reasons. In a resolution adopted in 1950, the International Labour Conference\nnoted the absence of international standards on the termination of\ncontract of employment and requested a report on national law and\npractice on the matter for consideration by the Conference. Following a\nnumber of studies carried out on the subject, in 1963 the Conference\nadopted the Termination of Employment Recommendation (No.119), the\nfirst international labour instrument dealing specifically with this issue. This instrument recommended certain fundamental standards with\nregard to justification for termination, notice, right to appeal,\ncompensation and income protection, and included provisions\nconcerning reduction of workforce. It marked the recognition at the\ninternational level of the idea that workers should be protected against\narbitrary and unjustified termination of their employment relationship\nand against the economic and social hardship inherent in their loss of\nemployment.",

From this perspective, the Labour Proclamation provides the following misdeeds\nto be serious misbehaviour warranting termination without notice:\n­ unless the reason for being late is justified by the collective agreement,\nwork rule or contract of employment, being late for duty eight times in six\nmonths period while being warned in writing of such a problem;\n­ absence from duty for a total of five days in six months period while being\nwarned in writing of such a problem; and where the absence cannot be\nclassified in any of the leaves provided under the Proclamation.",

    "text": "In order to verify the commission of these\nmisdeeds through a transparent procedure, it has been provided that the\nemployment of a worker shall not be terminated for reasons related to the\nworker’s conduct before he is provided an opportunity to defend himself against\nthe allegations made, unless the employee cannot reasonably be expected to\nprovide this opportunity (Article 7 of the Convention No.158/1982). Even though the labour proclamation does not have express provisions on the\nprocedure of the right to be heard, as the ILO Convention is ratified by Ethiopia,\nthe procedural safeguard of the ILO Convention should be read into the\nProclamation. The essential purpose of this procedure is to ensure that the\nemployee has an opportunity to express their view of the facts. The establishment\nof a disciplinary committee with a view to investigating the misdeed may serve\nthe purpose. However, the right to defend is not available in all cases and at all times. In cases\nwhere the employer cannot be reasonably expected to provide the right to be\nheard, the right can be withheld. This implies that if, for instance, the employee\nis found red-handed (at the spot) while committing the serious misdeed, the right\nto defend may not be available as it is manifestly visible act which makes further\ninvestigation unnecessary. Termination without notice is one of the most litigated issues before labour\ndivisions of regular courts in Ethiopia. There are cases that reached to the level\nof the Cassation Division in which this issue was addressed. In order to properly\nunderstand the law in action, consider the following cases:\n1. “ Absence from duty for a total of five days in six months period while\nbeing warned in writing of such a problem; and where the absence cannot\nbe classified in any of the leaves provided under the Proclamation”\n(Article 27(1)(b). In Water Action v. Yilma Assefa case (File No.29415;\nVol.6), Yilma, an employee of Water Action was transferred to another\njob position by the employer. He failed to report for duty at his new\n105\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nassignment. Five days elapsed. Water Action terminated the contract of\nemployment alleging that the employee absented himself from duty for\nfive days without good cause. The case was litigated up to the Cassation\nDivision. The Cassation Division held that the employer’s measure was\nlawful.",

Mekonnen Abera case (File No.32822; Vol:6), ruled\nthat what is expected for the employer is to merely show that the\nemployee absented himself from duty for five days. It is up to the\nemployee to challenge the contention by proving it had good cause to be\nabsent. 2. “ Deceitful or fraudulent conduct in carrying out his duties” (Article\n27(1)(c). In Filwuha Enterprise v. Bereket Teklemariam case (File\nNo.39543; Vol: 8), the Cassation Division entertained an alleged serious\nmisbehaviour of an employee. The facts of the case were: Bereket was\nemployed by Filwuha Enterprise (an enterprise engaged in the hospitality\nindustry) to prepare ice-cream intended for marketing to customers. He\nmanaged to hold this position by producing falsified documents stating\nthat he had an experience in preparing ice-cream from his previous\nemployer. But the quality of his ice-cream was too weak that he did not\nseem to have any clue as to how ice-cream is to be prepared. Filwuha Enterprise began to be suspicious of the accuracy of the\ndocument stating the employee’s previous job experience. The\nmanagement of the Filwuha Enterprise sent a team to the previous\nemployer of Bereket to verify the accuracy of the letter of service issued\nto Bereket. To the team’s surprise, however, such letter was not issued to\nhim by the previous employer. In fact, the original employer affirmed\nthat it did never prepare and serve ice-cream to customers. Based on this finding, Filwuha Enterprise terminated Bereket, alleging\nthat the employee committed deceitful and fraudulent practice in\ncarrying out his duties. But the employee objected the termination; and\ntook his case to court to reverse the termination and award reinstatement\n106\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nin his favour. The trial court held the termination unlawful, contending\nthat the fraudulent practice was committed not during carrying out of\nduties but earlier on during entry to employment. Although the case was\ntaken on appeal, the appellate court affirmed the decision of the lower\ncourt. However, the Cassation Division of the Federal Supreme Court reversed\nthe lower courts’ decision reasoning that the fraudulent practice of\nBereket was not limited to the time of employment but continued up to\nthe time of termination.",

    "text": "Fully aware that he did not have ice-cream\npreparation experience, he still pretended to have that qualification and\nthis conduct should be understood as a fraudulent practice in the process\nof carrying out duties. Thus the Cassation Division held that the\nemployer’s measure of termination in this regard is lawful. Do you agree? Incidentally, it is important to note that the above case was disposed based\non \nProclamation \nNo.377/2003. The \nrecently \nadopted \nLabour\nProclamation No.1156/2019 introduced a new provision that seems to\nhave been designed to fill this gap. It reads as follows. “ It shall be unlawful\nfor a worker to make use of falsified document or an attempt thereof”\n(Article 14(2)(c). The consequence as well has been determined as per\nArticle 27(1)(i), which is termination without notice. 3. In another case, in the Addis Ababa Hilton Hotel v. Yonas Tilahun case\n(File No.50009; Vol.: 9), a driver and an employee of the Addis Ababa\nHilton Hotel invited a guest for lunch in a subsidized cafeteria which was\nexclusively reserved for the employees of the Hotel. The Hotel held that\nthe employee’s act was fraudulent practice and as a result a dismissal was\nproper. The employee took his case to court contending that the\ntermination was unlawful. The lower courts held that though the act may be considered fraudulent,\nit was not grave enough to warrant dismissal. As a result, the Court\nannulled the decision of the employer. Although the Hotel took the case\n107\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nup to the Cassation Division, the latter upheld the lower courts’ decision,\nnoting that the employee’s job position was driving and the alleged\nmisdeed was not directly related to his job. Moreover, the misdeed was\nnot serious enough to subject the employee for dismissal because the\ncafeteria’s management should have placed its own control mechanism to\nprevent abuse of the subsidized meal benefit. 4. “ Being responsible for brawls or quarrels at work, having regard to the\ngravity of the case” (emphasis added) (Article 27(1)(f). The issue of what\namounts to “…being responsible to quarrels…” was litigated before the\nCassation Division as well. In a case between Ghion Travel Plc and Daniel\nAsfaw (File No. 49958; Vol.9), Daniel, the employee, was summarily\ndismissed for being responsible for quarrels at workplace. The facts of the\ncase were that, Daniel was an employee of the Plc and a driver.",

His supervisor informed him that his\nexpense reports and receipt were in exaggerated amounts and were not\nacceptable. Daniel intimidated his boss by stating that “if this receipt is\nnot reimbursed either I or you will die”. As a result, he was issued a letter\nof termination citing the fact that he was responsible for quarrels at work. Daniel took his case to court with a view to reversing the employer’s\ndecision. The trial court reasoned that the act of the employee is mere\ninsult or intimidation and does not amount to quarrels. Thus, it held the\ndismissal unlawful and ordered the reinstatement of the employee with\nfive months wage in the form of back pay. Although Ghion Travel lodged\nan appeal before the appellate court, the appellate court affirmed the\ndecision of the lower court. Finally, the case had to be examined by the Cassation Division. In\nreversing the lower courts’ decision, the Cassation Division reasoned that\nwithin the framework of employment relations, when asked by his\n108\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nsupervisor an employee should answer satisfactorily and respectfully. In\nthe present case, however, the employee resorted to intimidation and\naggressive behaviour while lawfully asked to explain issues by his\nsuperior. This act, according to the Cassation Division, amounts to being\nresponsible for quarrels as per the meaning and intent of the law. Thus, it\nheld that the measure taken by the employer was lawful. 5. In World Vision Ethiopia v. Mezemir Mekbib case (File No. 79105;\nVol.13), Mezemir was accused of committing sexual harassment and\nsexual violence against his workmate at night, in a residence camp\nestablished by the employer. The employer held that Mezemir was\nresponsible for quarrels at work. As a result, he was dismissed pursuant to\nArticle 27(1)(f). Mezemir challenged the dismissal and requested the court to nullify the\nemployer’s measure, alleging that the misdeed was not committed at work\nas per the stipulation of the law. The court with original jurisdiction held\nthat since the act was committed at a residence established by the\nemployer for its employees, it should be considered as a workplace and\nhence the decision of the employer to terminate the employee was lawful. The case was presented on appeal by the employee in order to have the\ndecision of the lower court reversed.",

    "text": "The appellate court, for its part,\ndecided that since the alleged act was committed at a residence and during\nthe night, it could not be considered as though it was committed at work\nbecause the residence camp was not a workplace, and the night was not\nworking time. Thus, it held that the termination was unlawful. At the level of the Cassation Division the case was handled differently. The Cassation Division argued that “a workplace is any area where an\nemployee is found while carrying out his employer’s order, even away\nfrom the work place or outside his normal hours of work” (Article 97(1). Accordingly, the victim employee was situated in the residence camp in\norder to carry out her employer’s instructions. Hence there was no reason\n109\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nwhy this place (residence camp) and time (outside of working hours-at\nnight) should not be treated as part of the workplace. Therefore, the\nCassation Division reversed the appellate court’s decision and affirmed\nthe decision of the trial court that held dismissal was lawful in this case. 6. “ Being responsible for causing damage intentionally or through gross\nnegligence to any property of the employer or to another property which\nis directly connected with the work of the undertaking” (emphasis added)\n(Article 27(1) (h). In a certain court case, how “…gross negligence” was\nto be assessed was the main issue. In Midroc Construction Plc. V. Ato\nMoges Shiferaw case (File No.41115; Vol.8), Ato Moges, a big truck\noperator of Midroc, left the key of the vehicle in the truck and left the\nvehicle. His assistant driver, though unauthorized, moved the truck and\ncaused damage to property. Midroc was of the view that the act of Ato\nMoges was gross negligence and due to his actions, damage to property\nhas been incurred. As a result he was dismissed. Ato Moges objected to the measure and contended that the termination was\nunlawful. He requested reinstatement with back pay. The lower court accepted\nMogese’s claim and awarded him reinstatement with four months’ wage back\npay. The Appellate court confirmed the lower court’s holding. The Cassation Division discussed at length as to whether Ato Moges’s act in the\npresent case amounted to gross negligence. According to the Cassation Division’s\nreasoning, in principle a truck driver has strict professional responsibility as to\nhow to handle the truck’s key.",

    "text": "But in the present case the truck was within the\ncompound of the employer’s premises; and an assistant driver was within the\nvicinity of the truck. Given these two important facts, it is difficult to consider\nthat the act was gross negligence. It seems that had it been in public space and in\nthe absence of the assistant driver, the case might have been decided differently. The other issue of contention in connection with termination due to serious\nbehavioural problem of the employee is its relation with criminal sanction or\n110\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nacquittal. This issue becomes relevant since one single act may be a source of\ndisciplinary and criminal proceeding. For instance, let us assume an employee\nwas alleged to have committed theft at workplace and was subjected to\ndisciplinary investigation. Let us further assume that the same incident was\nreported to the police and a police investigation was being undertaken\nsimultaneously. On the disciplinary track, the Disciplinary Committee\ndetermined that the alleged wrongdoing was indeed committed and hence the\nCommittee recommends that the employee be dismissed without notice. The\nGeneral Manager acted as per the recommendation of the Committee. The criminal justice track, on the other hand, would take longer to finalize the\ninvestigation. After the police submit their investigation report to the\nprosecution office, the prosecution office could then file charges against the\nsuspected employee before a criminal bench. However, the court, after\nexamining the law and the evidence submitted to it might arrive at the conclusion\nthat there was no sufficient evidence to convict the suspect, thereby acquitting\nhim. Now the issue is what impact, if any, will the acquittal have on the dismissal\nfrom employment? Should the employee be reinstated now that she has been\nexonerated from criminal liability? This will take us towards resolving the issue\nas to what effect does criminal liability or non-liability have on the disciplinary\nmeasure. The Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division was confronted with a very\nsimilar issue in Ethiopian Electric and Power Authority (EELPA) v. Dereje\nWoldekidan case (File No.34585; Vol.6). Dereje, an employee of EELPA, was\ncaught red-handed while taking out, without due authorization, eight cans (160\nlitres of transformer lubricant oil) that belonged to the employer. Due to this, he\nwas terminated automatically as per Article 27(1)(d) of the labour proclamation. Dereje challenged the employer’s measure, contending that it was unlawful\ntermination because he was exonerated from criminal prosecution.",

    "text": "The first\ninstance court to which the case was originally submitted, held that the act was\nmere “attempt” and since the Criminal Bench found there was no sufficient\n111\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nevidence to convict him, the termination was unlawful and hence Dereje should\nbe reinstated. Although EELPA appealed against the decision of the first instance\ncourt, the appellate court affirmed the lower court’s holding. It was after this litigation that the case was brought to the attention of the\nCassation Division. The Cassation Division viewed the case differently from the\nway the lower courts did. According to the Cassation Division, employer\ndisciplinary measures and criminal justice have distinct objectives. Disciplinary\nmeasures are an in-house and administrative measure while criminal prosecution\nis punishing the offender’s dangerous disposition towards society at large. Thus,\nevidence required to convict the accused in criminal proceeding is of higher\nthreshold (i.e. beyond reasonable doubt standard). Conversely, the evidence\ndemanded for disciplinary sanction is less rigorous (i.e. balance of probabilities\nstandard). Hence, someone who may be acquitted based on the higher standard\nof proof in a criminal proceeding may still be liable of violating work rules in the\nlight of the lower standard of proof. Therefore, criminal acquittal may not\nprovide immunity from disciplinary sanction. Consequently, the Cassation\nDivision reversed the decision of the lower courts and affirmed the employer’s\nmeasure. Similar lines of interpretation were handed down by the Cassation\nDivision in Addis Ababa Cultural Restruant v. Yewubdar Tilahun (File No. 37256;\nVol.8); Ethiopian Electric and Power Authority v. Kebede Abunetie (File\nNo.42292; Vol.8) and in a case between Ethiopian Seed Enterprise v. Hailemariam\nSharew (File No.59906; Vol.11)\nAnother issue deserving consideration as regards termination without notice is\nthe time within which the measure should be taken. The reason why the law\nallows the employer to terminate the employee instantly under this provision is\nthe misdeed committed by the employee is so intolerable that the employer\nwould not be expected to remain engaged with the employee until the notice\nperiod expires. Hence the right is to be exercised within short span of time of\nhaving knowledge of the occurrence of the ground for termination. 112\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAccordingly, Article 27(3) stipulates that the right of an employer to terminate a\ncontract of employment without notice shall lapse after thirty working days from\nthe date the employer know the existence of a ground of termination.",

    "text": "If the\nemployer allows the expiry of this period of time without reacting, it may be\nassumed that the misconduct was not sufficiently serious to justify termination\nof employment or the employer has waived its right to take action. In fact ILO\nRecommendation No. 119 provides that “an employer should have deemed to\nhave waived his right to dismiss for serious misconduct if, such action has not\nbeen taken within a reasonable time after he has become aware of the serious\nmisconduct.” Therefore, this right is not open to the employer indefinitely. However, where the alleged misdeed makes the investigation of the\ncircumstances of the conduct necessary, the time required for such an\ninvestigation would not be included within the thirty working days limit because\nknowledge as to the existence of a ground of termination will be obtained once\nthe investigation is completed. The Cassation Division adopted this line of\ninterpretation in Ethiopian Postal Service v. Tilahun Kumma case (File No.53358;\nVol.9). Similar ruling was taken in Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority\nv. Admasu Demsachew (File No.41767; Vol.9). Interestingly, however, the\nCassation Division seemed to have adopted different view in Guder Agro-\nindustry v. Belete Chala case (File No.45746: Vol.9). ( Please compare the cases\nand determine for yourself which position of the Cassation Division makes sense\nfor you). Finally, under this section, suspending an employee from the job as well as\nsuspending the worker from receiving wages is available to the employer while\nthe investigation is pending. For this purpose, the labour proclamation provides;\nthe grounds for suspension of a worker from duty before terminating the contract\nof employment of the worker in accordance with this Article may be determined\nby collective agreement; provided, however, that the duration of suspension shall\nnot exceed thirty working days (Article 27(4). 113\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nAlthough the maximum duration of suspension is capped by law to be thirty\nworking days, the actual date is to be determined by a collective agreement. Collective agreement implies bilateral determination between an employer and\nthe trade union concerned. But the Cassation Division is of the view that even in\nthe absence of collective agreement, the employer in its prerogative as an\nemployer can unilaterally suspend an employee without deviating from the legal\nmaximum (Dashen Bank v. Zenebe Dinkesssa: File No. 53985; Vol.11). Do you\nagree with the ruling of the Cassation Division? Why? Why not?",

It is rather open to revision before a\nlabour tribunal if the employee decides to pursue the matter further. For this\npurpose, the labour proclamation has prescribed that any claim by a worker to be\nreinstated shall be barred after three months from the date of termination of the\ncontract of employment (Article 163(2) or if the requested remedy is for payment\nof compensation associated with unlawful termination, it is six months (Article\n163(4); and the organ that is empowered to entertain such claims is the First\nInstance Court Labour Division (Article 139(1)(a). - \nTermination with notice (ordinary dismissal)\nTermination of the employment relation, with reason or no reason, by providing\nnotice to the other party was a lawful and ordinary action during the earlier times\nin labour history.

    "text": "The following grounds relating to loss of capacity of, and situations\naffecting the worker shall constitute good cause for terminating a contract\nof employment with prior notice where;\na) the worker’s manifest loss of capacity to perform the work to which\nhe has been assigned; and his lack of skill to continue his work as a\nresult of his refusal or inability to make use of an opportunity of\ntraining arranged by the employer to upgrade his skill or after having\nbeen trained, his inability to acquire the necessary skill;\nb) the worker is, for reasons of health or disability, permanently unable\nto carry out his obligation under the contract of employment;\nc) the worker’s unwillingness to move to a locality where the\nundertaking relocates;\nd) the post of the worker is cancelled for good cause and the worker\ncannot be transferred to another job position. We will consider them one by one herein below:\n- the worker’s manifest loss of capacity to perform the work to which he has been\nassigned (Article 28(1)(b);\nA lack of capacity, or aptitude, on the part of a worker can take two forms. It can\nresult from lack of the skills or qualities necessary to perform certain tasks,\nleading to unsatisfactory performance. Lack of capacity is therefore distinct from\nbad conduct, for which it is necessary to demonstrate certain degree of “guilt” on\nthe part of the worker. Where the poor performance is associated with\nintentional conduct to that effect, it will be an issue of summary dismissal as it is\na behavioural problem. 115\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nPoor performance not caused by intentional conduct, as well as various degrees\nof incapacity to perform work as a result of illness or injury, are covered by the\nconcept of the capacity of the worker. The worker can thus be offered some\nsafeguards with regard to termination of employment for reasons connected with\ncapacity, such as careful assessment of his work, warning him about the possible\nconsequences if the quality of his work does not improve, and allowing him to\ndemonstrate his skills and to improve his work performance by arranging\ncapacity building programmes. It is after all these efforts that termination will be\nconsidered as a last resort. Even in that case, unlike the employee with serious\nbehavioural problem who is denied of notice (Article 27), the employee should\nbe given advance notice prior to termination. In the world of practice, how to measure an employee’s lack of capacity has been\na very controversial issue.",

    "text": "The employer would often tend to argue that the\nemployee has had reduced capacity in performing work duties that would justify\ntermination with notice. The employee would likely challenge the employer’s\nmeasure alleging that a lack of capacity was not convincingly proved. Courts have\nhad difficulties in deciding one way or the other, as the issue could be subjective. The current labour proclamation tried to minimize the subjectivity aspect of this\nissue by prescribing the following. Pursuant to Article 28(2) it is stated that “any\nloss of capacity of work referred to in sub-Article (1)(a) of this Article shall, unless\notherwise provided by a collective agreement, be verified by a periodical job\nperformance evaluation”. Other than how to evaluate, what is to be evaluated needs clarification as well. In a certain Cassation Division case (Holy Angels v. Melkamu Alemayehu: File\nNo. 82335; Vol.14), an employee, an Amharic language teacher, was employed in\na private school to teach Amharic. As his teaching load was low in the Amharic\nlanguage section, he was assigned to teach the English language, too. Fee-paying\nstudents were seriously unhappy regarding the teacher’s performance in teaching\nEnglish. As a result, the School terminated the teacher, alleging that he had poor\njob performance in the English language. 116\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nThe teacher objected to the employer’s measure of termination and brought his\ncase to court. The case reached to the level of the Federal Supreme Court\nCassation Division. The Cassation Division ultimately held that “whenever an\nemployee’s performance is to be assessed, it must be in light of the job position\nhe was employed to perform. Consequently, the Cassation Division held that the\nteacher’s performance should have been established in light of his performance\non Amharic language teaching.” Thus the termination was held unlawful. - the worker is, for reasons of health or disability, permanently unable to carry\nout his obligation under the contract of employment (Article 28(1)(b);\nThe other ground of termination under this section, is permanent disablement of\nthe employee for reasons of health or disability. Since the worker is required to\nrender the agreed service in person, if she no longer is unable to provide the\nservice, it would be unfair and uneconomical for the employer to remain\nengaged. In fact, this ground of termination seems to be similar with what has\nbeen provided under Article 24(5).",

    "text": "Problem for discussion:\nTermination under Article 24 is termination by the operation of the law\nand hence the employee is not eligible to notice; whereas termination\nunder Article 28 entitles an employee for notice. Article 24(5) and Article\n28(1)(b) seem to be similarly phrased. How is an employee who is to be\nterminated under 24(5) different from an employee who is to be terminated\nunder Article 28(1)(b)? Would Article 39(1)(g) be of some help in clarifying\nthe ambiguity? - The worker’s unwillingness to move to a locality where the undertaking\nrelocates (Article 28(1)(c);\n117\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nEnterprises from time to time may make many economically rational decisions \nin order to remain competitive and profitable. One of the possible decisions is \nrelocating the enterprise from one locality to another for purposes of becoming \nnearer to input products, to market or any economically justifiable reason. In \nsuch cases what will be the fate of the employees who were employed for the \noriginal location is an issue. Should they be compelled to relocate? Should \nrelocation depend upon their willingness to move or not? This provision is an attempt to resolve this issue. According to the provision, \nmobility should depend on the willingness of the employee in the sense that if \nthe employee is unwilling to relocate this should not be considered as a \ndisciplinary problem. Rather the employee should be separated with a benefit of \nnotice because the employee should not be compelled to modify the terms of the \ncontract out of her consent. However, this issue should not be confused with assigning an employee to a \nbranch office. Transferring an employee from one work place to another; or from \none job position to another is within an employer’s prerogative. Failure to comply \nwith such an instruction would result in dismissal without notice. Nevertheless, \nit must be noted that this employer’s power may be restricted by a contract of \nemployment or collective agreement. - the post of the worker is cancelled for good cause and the worker cannot be\ntransferred to another job position (Article 28(1)(d). Employers are at liberty to structure and re-structure their work methods. Regulatory organs may also hand down instructions that may affect the\noperational and organizational set up of the enterprises. These internally or\nexternally driven measures may bring about cancellation of certain job positions\nexposing employees to termination. In such cases, employees whose job positions\nare cancelled may be subjected to termination with notice if it is not possible to\ntransfer them to another job position.",

    "text": "In Dandiboru University College v. Teklu\nUrge et al (File No. 40804; Vol.8) case, the Ministry of Education issued a\ndirective to the effect it would not accredit trainees who studied teachers’\ntraining courses in private colleges. Dandiboru, a private college, had to terminate\nthe contracts of employment of Teklu and others who were offering courses to\nteacher trainers contending that their job positions were cancelled for good cause. 118\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAlthough Teklu and others challenged, before court of law, the decision of the\ncollege claiming that the termination was unlawful, the Cassation Division ruled\nthat the termination was lawful. The Cassation Division did not even inquire\nwhether there was a possibility to transfer Teklu and others to another job\nposition or not. In fact, in Selam Tesfaye v. Alkan Plc (File No.69125; Vol.13)\ncase, the Cassation Division ruled that if the job position’s cancellation was due\nto a legal instrument by the relevant government organ, not only that the\ntermination is lawful but also that the terminated employee is not entitled to\npayment in lieu of notice and severance payment. Do you agree? In Rehobot Holy Savour Plc v. Amare Admassu (File No.38811; Vol.8) case,\nAmare was terminated from employment on the ground that his job position was\ncancelled for good cause. Amare took his case to court, the lower court held that\neven if the employee’s position was cancelled for good cause, the employer did\nnot show that transferring the employee to another job position was not possible. Thus it ruled that the termination was unlawful. While reversing the lower\ncourt’s decision, the Cassation Division argued that once the employer proves\nthat the job position of the employee is cancelled for good cause, it is up to the\nterminated employee to show that it would have been possible to assign her to\nanother job position. In the present case, Amare did not submit such contention\nand hence the termination is lawful. Termination with notice is not only attributed to lack of capacity of the employee\nor other elements mentioned under Article 28(1) above. There are other grounds\nassociated with organizational or operational requirements of the undertaking,\nwhich may warrant termination with notice as well. For this purpose, referring\nArticle 28(3) would be appropriate.",

    "text": "Of\ncourse, operational and organizational requirements may at times be difficult to\ndistinguish because they are closely interconnected. Be that as it may, alteration\nof work methods may bring about a change in organizational structure of an\nundertaking. A typical example of this arrangement is “outsourcing” of services. In order to promote specialization and efficiency, undertakings may decide to\nfocus their activities within the framework of their “core” businesses, leaving the\n‘peripheral activities’ to be rendered by other service providers based on\ncommercial contracts. This may have an impact on the organizational structure\nof the undertaking in the sense that services which were formerly provided by\nemployees are now to be offered by contractors. This is what we called as\n“triangular employment relationship” in the previous chapter. Outsourcing brought a paradigm shift to employment relation in the sense that\nthe bilateral (employee-employer) engagement has been transformed into\ntriangular (tripartite) relation. In this arrangement, the employment relationship\nmay be objectively ambiguous or disguised. The problems faced by workers\ninvolved in “triangular” employment relationships pose different legal questions. These are workers employed by an enterprise (the “service provider”) who\nperform work for a third party (the “user”) to whom their employer provides\nlabour or services. Legally, they have contracts of employment with the “service\nprovider;” whereas in real terms they render service to the “user.” These\nemployees frequently face difficulties in establishing who their employer is, what\ntheir rights are; and who is responsible for them. In this regard, changes in the legal status of workers, whether real or apparent,\nseem to be a sign of the times and are commonly observed not only in traditional\nsectors such as transport (truck drivers, taxi drivers), construction and clothing,\n121\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nbut in new areas as well, such as sales stuff in department stores, or certain jobs\nin wholesale distribution or in private security agencies, though there are\nconsiderable differences from one country to another and from region to region. One of the grounds for termination of a contract of employment with notice,\ntherefore, is alteration of working methods one of which is outsourcing of\nservices to a commercial service provider rather than performing it by own (in-\nhouse) employees. Due to this new work method, employees who were tasked to\nthe outsourced activity will be redundant and exposed to termination with\nnotice.",

    "text": "On this topic, the Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division, in many\ninstances, has held that outsourcing of service provision is a lawful way of\noperating a business and any termination as a result of this change is a lawful\nground for termination (Commercial Bank of Ethiopia v. Haile G/Silassie: File\nNo.22275; Vol. 6) and SOS Children’s Village v. Kebede Kumsa et al: File\nNo.38435; Vol.8). Introduction of new technologies has an equivalent effect as\nwell. New technology (capital intensiveness) has the effect of labour\ndisplacement as tasks which were formerly undertaken by labour will be\nperformed by technology. As a result, employees may be exposed to termination\ndue to redundancy. Other grounds of termination under this heading, as indicated above, are\nattributed to operational reasons. An enterprise may be driven out of the market\nby rival companies and its market share may shrink; or demand for its products\nmay be reduced or its profit may fall. If such economic situation is left unchecked,\nit may ultimately lead to bankruptcy and Article 24(4) may become relevant. Thus, in order to prevent the occurrence of total collapse (bankruptcy), the law\nhas put a safety valve under Article 28(3) in the sense that saving the enterprise\nby sacrificing the job security of some employees was found appropriate. Indeed, organizational and operational requirements of an undertaking may have\nan adverse effect of displacing appreciable number of employees.

Pursuant to Article 29(1) whenever at least 10% of the labour\nforce is to be affected by the termination, it is no longer an issue to be left to the\ndiscretion of the employer. In such cases, the law prescribes a rigorous procedure\nof layoffs under which the employer will be obligated to consult with\nrepresentatives of the employees concerned. It must be noted, however, that the\nobligation of the employer in this regard is a mere consultation not the obligation\nto reach at an agreement with employees’ representatives. In a sense, it is a ‘soft\nobligation’ in that the employees’ representatives will be given an opportunity to\nexpress their views and concerns to which the employer may take them into\naccount while making and taking decisions. Hence, there is no duty to reach at\nan agreement in this regard.",

    "text": "Furthermore, the law has spelt out list of priority for\ntermination where its implementation is to be observed by the parties to the\nconsultation (Article 29(3). It reads as follows:\nWhenever a reduction of workforce takes place in accordance with Article 28(3)\nof this proclamation the employer shall conduct consultation with a trade union\nor workers’ representatives in order to retain workers having skills and higher\nrate of productivity in their posts. In case of comparable skill and rate of\nproductivity, the workers to be affected first by the reduction shall be in the\nfollowing order:\na) Those having the shortest length of service in the undertaking; [Last in\nFirst out: LIFO]\nb) Those having fewer dependents;\nc) The reduction shall affect first workers except those that are listed under\n(d) up to [and] (e) of this sub-Article;\nd) Those employees with disability;\ne) Those who sustained employment injury in the undertaking;\nf) Workers representatives; and\ng) Expectant mothers and mothers within four months post-natal. 123\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nThere are policy rationales behind this list of priority of termination. First, the\nlaw prescribes that employees having skills and higher rate of productivity shall\nbe retained. It thus encourages acquisition of skill and being productive. Second,\nseniority will be taken in to account in that those who have the shortest length\nof service are to be terminated first. This again encourages low labour turnover. Third, a “social selection” mechanism has been introduced in the sense that those\nwho may be affected most by the termination should be terminated at a later\nstage of the termination process. It is believed that employees with appreciable\nnumber of dependents; employees with disability and mothers would be affected\nmost in case of job losses. This is one area where the social concern of the law is\nmanifested. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning that MOLSA, pursuant to the\npower given to it under Article 171(1)(h) of the Labour Proclamation, has already\nissued a directive that stipulates the procedures for reduction of labour force. Although the law seems to prescribe consultation with workers’ representatives\nor trade unions and comply with the priority list stipulated under Article 29(3)\nin cases where the reduction of the labour force affects at least 10% of the work\nforce, as per Article 29(1), the Cassation Division tends to hold different view.

The notice period is thirty days\nfor all, regardless of seniority. Actually, under Labour Proclamation No.42/1993,\nthe notice period was only fifteen days. Private sector employers had concerns in the sense that some job positions could\nnot be filled within thirty days. As a result, they had proposed a longer notice\nperiod of resignation for skilled labourers during the revision of the law. However, their proposal was not accepted for the reasons set out below. First, according to the government representatives who spelt out their positions,\nat the time of considering the law revision, obligating the employee to remain in\nhis employment without his will for more than thirty days amounted to forced\nlabour and hence was unconstitutional. Article 18 of the Ethiopian Federal\nConstitution prohibits forced labour. Second, it is even unproductive to retain an\nemployee for so long where that worker has lost interest in the position, which\nmight be detrimental to the employer’s economic interest as well. Third, if the\nemployee is truly indispensable to the employer, it is advisable to retain that\nworker by offering an attractive benefit package rather than through legal\nprohibition (use carrot rather than stick). Indeed, strategically, the best way to\ncounteract such a problem is to avoid heavy reliance on an individual by\nestablishing a well-considered succession plan ahead of time in the sense that\n127\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nevery employee should have back-ups. After all, even if that worker does not\ndecide to resign, the worker could die or fall sick; that makes heavy reliance on\nindividuals inappropriate. In Shewit Hailu v. Defence Construction Enterprise (File No.104465; Vol.18)\ncase, the employee tendered a letter of resignation but the employer did not\nrespond to the letter.",

    "text": "The employee continued working and the parties remained\nengaged for another seven months after which the employer wrote a letter that\nit has accepted the resignation. The employee contended that this is unlawful\ntermination. The lower courts held that the contract was terminated due to\nresignation of the employee. While reversing the lower courts’ ruling, the\nCassation Division reasoned that the parties resumed their contractual\nengagement for seven months after the submission of the letter of resignation\nindicates that the plan to separate was nullified by their conduct. Thus,\nresignation cannot be the ground of termination under the circumstances. Hence,\nit held the termination unlawful. Problem for discussion:\nLet us assume that an employee submitted a written notice of resignation\non 13 July 2021 stating that she will quit her job on the 12 August 2021. This letter was delivered to the enterprise’s register on the 13th of July. The Manager issued an acceptance of resignation effective 14th July 2021. The employee had no plan to quit job on the 14th of July. Rather her plan\nwas to quit job on the 12th of August 2021 and she was surprised and\nworried to receive that letter. What, if any, would you advise her? In this connection, what meaning would you give to Article 35(4)? Incidentally, under the civil service employment regime, it is stated that\n“any civil servant may by giving one month prior notice, resign at any\ntime, provided however that the government institution may release him\nprior to the end of the notice period if it can easily replace him”\n128\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n(underline added) (Article 83(1)-Federal Civil Servants’ Proclamation\nNo.1064/2017). Under the civil service employment regime, where the service of the Civil\nServant is indispensable and he could not be replaced easily, his release may, in\nagreement with his future employer, be delayed for a period not exceeding three\nmonths counted from the date of application (Article 83(3). This provision seems\nto anticipate that the civil servant after resigning would be employed elsewhere;\nand consultation between the original employer and the prospective employer\nshall be undertaken. However, what happens if the employee is not planning to\nbe re-employed elsewhere after resignation remains unanswered. Problem for discussion:\nWhat justification, if any, could be offered for this differential type of\ntreatment in which private sector has only one month advance notice,\nwhile the civil service sector can prolong the notice period up to three\nmonths?",

    "text": "Would public interest concerns be relevant? What happens if the employee fails to provide prior notice of resignation is a\nlegitimate question, which should be addressed. The labour and the civil service\ninstruments stipulate varied solutions. As per the Labour Proclamation, “a worker\nwho terminates his contract of employment in disregards of the notice\nrequirement shall be liable to pay compensation to the employer. However, the\ncompensation payable shall not exceed 30 days’ wages of the worker and be\npayable from the remaining payment due to the worker” (Article 45). Pursuant\nto the civil service regulatory framework, however, it is stipulated that “any civil\nservant, who has terminated his service without giving one month notice shall\n129\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nhave civil and criminal liability for any damage cause by such failure” (Article\n83(2). However, the Cassation Division in Addis Gas and Plastic Factory v.\nSolomon Hailu; File No.119448: Vol.21) ruled that the employer cannot by its\nown deduct the one month’s wage of the employee. It must be verified and\ndetermined by the appropriate tribunal or the employee must have consented to\nthe deduction. Do you agree with the holding of the Cassation Division? Is that\nreally the legislative intent? - \nResignation without notice (extra-ordinary resignation)\nThis is a situation where the employee may lawfully resign without offering the\nbenefit of notice to the employer. Earlier, within the framework of termination\nby the employer without notice (summary dismissal), we have seen that the\nemployee’s serious misbehaviour entitled the employer to terminate the worker\nwithout even giving the benefit of notice. Similarly, under resignation without\nnotice, it is the employer’s serious misbehaviour against the employee that\ncompels the latter to resign without giving the benefit of advance notice to the\nemployer. The relevant provision which is Article 32 of the Labour Proclamation\nreads as follows:\nTermination of contract of employment without prior notice\n1.",

    "text": "The following shall be good causes [for the employee] to terminate a\ncontract of employment without prior notice:\na) Where the employer has committed any act contrary to human\ndignity and morals or other acts punishable under the Criminal Law\nagainst the worker;\nb) Where the worker has been a victim of sexual harassment or sexual\nviolence by the employer or a managerial employee;\nc) In the case of imminent danger threatening the worker’s safety or\nhealth, where the employer, having been made aware of such danger,\nfailed to act within the time limit in accordance with the early\n130\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nwarning given by the competent authority or appropriate trade union\nor the worker himself to avert the danger;\nd) Where the employer has repeatedly failed to fulfil his basic\nobligations towards the worker as prescribed under this Proclamation,\ncollective agreement, work rules or other relevant laws. As can be noted from the listing above, it is the misdeed of the employer or its\nrepresentatives that provoked the employee to terminate. At times it is termed as\n“constructive dismissal” to mean that the employer is indirectly dismissing the\nemployee in such cases. It is interesting to note that Article 32(1)(b) was not\nincluded under the previous labour law. Women employees who were victims of\nsexual harassment and sexual violence at work were inclined to rely on the\nprovision which states where the employer has committed any act contrary to\nhuman dignity and morals or other acts punishable under the Criminal Law\nagainst the worker (Article 32(1)(a)) because sexual harassment and sexual\nviolence were considered to be acts contrary to human dignity and morals. In\nfact, they are punishable under the Criminal Law as well. Nevertheless, the new\nlabour law expressly includes these grounds for resignation. With the establishment and development of industrial parks, the labour profile\nin these locations has been predominantly female, poor, young and illiterate\ncoming from rural areas devoid of parental supervision. The production process\nin these locations has been characterized by working together in large numbers;\nin close proximity with each other in shifts including late night shifts. These\nfactors increased the vulnerability of women and girls to sexual offences. In this\nregard, reports of abuse have been pervasive. Therefore, the need arises for\nexpressly stating these issues in the regulatory framework together with multiple\nsanctions which will be discussed later on in this text. Similar to what we elaborated under summary dismissal, invoking summary\nresignation is limited in time.",

    "text": "Article 33 of the Labour Proclamation stated that\n“a worker’s right to terminate his contract of employment with Article 32 (1)\nabove of this proclamation shall expire after fifteen working days from the date\n131\nTermination of Contract of Employment\non which the act occurred or ceased to exist.” The assumption of the law is that\nif the employee did not resign promptly as soon as the grave mistreatment\noccurred or ceased to occur, it will be considered as though the worker has\ntolerated it. It does not, however, mean that the worker cannot resign. Even after\nthe expiry of the fifteen working days period, the worker can still resign based\non ordinary dismissal (i.e. Article 31). 3.2. Consequences Associated with Lawful Termination\nAll grounds of termination discussed above are lawful grounds. Therefore, under\nthis topic, we will examine the entitlements available (exit/separation package)\nto the separated employee at the time of termination. Under the Civil Code, it\nwas only when the employee was terminated on unlawful grounds that payment\nin the form of “compensation” was due with a maximum of three months wage. Four years later, by virtue of Regulation No. 302/1964 the compensation\nassociated with unlawful termination was increased to a maximum of six months\nwage in the name of “severance pay”. For lawful terminations, however, payment\nof wages and other benefits for services render until the time of termination were\nthe only entitlements under the Civil Code. It was with the coming in to force of Labour Proclamation No. 64/1975 that even\nemployees who were terminated on lawful grounds were entitled to certain\npayments. The concept of “compensation for service” was introduced by that\nproclamation. Based on the concept, an employee whose contract of employment\nwas terminated pursuant to the provisions of the proclamation was eligible to\npayment of compensation for service (Article 17). The amount of the\ncompensation was one month’s wage for the first year of service; and one-third\nof that amount for every additional year of service. The maximum payment was\ntwelve months wages of the employee (Article 17(2). This means it was a\ngenerally available benefit in the sense that all terminated employees regardless\nof the ground of termination were eligible to this benefit. It was rather severance\n132\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\npayment which was available only for two grounds of termination and the\namount was two months wage (Article 16).",

    "text": "The compensation for service entitlement was carried-over to Labour\nProclamation No.42/993. However, with the coming in to effect of Labour\nProclamation No.377/2003, the concept of “compensation for service” was\navoided altogether and “severance payment” has been introduced with different\nmeaning and content which we shall see it below. Pursuant to Proclamation No.377/2003 and the current labour law, entitlements\nassociated with lawful termination are varied in nature. Broadly, such\nentitlements could be categorized as: generally available entitlements and ground\nbased entitlements. They may also be monetary entitlements or non-monetary\nentitlements. Generally available entitlements\nGenerally available entitlements are both monetary and non-monetary benefits\naccorded to the terminated employee regardless of the grounds for termination. It means these benefits are available to all terminated employees. Ground based\nentitlements, for their part, are monetary benefits available to an ex-employee\ndepending upon the particular grounds on which termination is based. Let us begin our elaboration with the generally available entitlements. Article\n77(4) provides that a worker whose contract of employment is terminated\npursuant to this Proclamation shall be entitled to his pay for the leave he has not\ntaken [utilized]. This benefit is available to all employees whose contract of\nemployment was terminated pursuant to all grounds stipulated by the Labour\nProclamation. In principle, it is prohibited to convert annual leave into cash. Rather it should be utilized in kind. Therefore, Article 77(4) is an exception to\nthe general principle enshrined under Article 76(2). The entitlement is a\nmonetary benefit because the unutilized annual leave is to be converted into cash\nand paid to the separated employee. However, it is important to note that it is not\n133\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nall unutilized annual leave that will be converted into cash because annual leave\ncannot be accumulated for more than two years (Article 79(4). Moreover, Article 12(8) of the Labour Proclamation obligates the employer to\nissue a certificate of service in favour of the terminated employee which specifies\nthe type of work he performed, the length of service and the wage he was earning,\nfree of charge, upon termination of a contract of employment. Technically this is\na non-monetary benefit. But, still, it is a benefit because the certificate would\ntypically assist the terminated employee in an effort to look for an alternative\nemployment elsewhere. This certificate is available to all terminated employees\nas well irrespective of the ground of termination (except may be an employee\nwhose employment was terminated upon death).",

    "text": "In fact, even an employee who was terminated due to serious misbehaviour is\nentitled to a “clean” certificate of service because it is provided that nothing\nunfavourable to the employee shall be inserted in such a certificate (Article\n2588(2) Civil Code). ILO Recommendation No.119 in its Article 8(2) has a similar\nstipulation. It provides “nothing unfavourable to the worker should be inserted\nin such certificate.” The rationale seems, since disciplinary measure is an internal\nin-house measure, its effect should remain in-house as well. It is feared that\nunfavourable terms inserted in certificate of service may adversely affect the\nfuture employability of the ex-employee. The employer should not be allowed to\npossess the full power to destroy the future career of its employees. To sum up,\nconversion of unutilized annual leave into cash and issuance of “clean” certificate\nof service are the generally available entitlements upon separation.

Probation period, as indicated earlier, is a trial period available to\nthe employer to enable it determine the suitability of the employee to the job\nposition the employee is anticipated to assume (Article 11 (1). For this purpose,\nthe law has allocated a maximum sixty working days counting from the first date\nof employment (Article11 (3).

    "text": "Rather\nprobation period must be agreed by the parties and must be made in writing\n(Article 11 (3). This means if the written contract of employment or the letter of\nemployment is silent about probation period, the law assumes that the employee\nhas been employed for no probation period. Therefore, the requirement of\ncompletion of probation period may be satisfied either by working a maximum\nsixty working days since the start of employment or lower than that duration. Furthermore, an employee who is eligible for a pension payment as soon as his\ncontract of employment is terminated is not eligible for severance pay. In a sense,\nthe legislative intent is that severance pay and pension payment are not\nsimultaneously available. For instance, an employee who attains the age of\nretirement may be terminated (Article 24(3) and hence will be eligible for\npension pay provided that the worker had ten years of minimum service; the\nretiree would thereby denied receiving severance pay. However, it must be noted\nthat if the employer shows willingness to pay both, the law does not have any\nobjection (Boset Children and Family Charity Organization v. Alem Shimeles;\nFile No.151474: Vol.23). This issue will take us towards analysing when and how eligibility for pension\npayment is to be determined. In order to dispose this issue, since the Labour\nProclamation does not   provide a solution for this, there is a need to consult “The\nPrivate Organization Employees’ Pension Proclamation (Proc. No.1267/2014 as\n136\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\namended).” Based on this Pension Proclamation, for someone to be eligible for\npension payment:\n­ pension contribution must have been made under his name on monthly basis\n(i.e.,11% of the employee’s wage to be contributed by the employer and 7%\nof the employee’s wage to be deducted from the employee’s wage and\ndelivered to the “Pension Fund” every month); and\n­ minimum of ten years employment service ; and\n­ attainment of sixty years of age; or\n­ attainment of fifty-five years of age with 25 five years of service and\nseparated from service by his own initiative; or\n­ Completion of at least 10 year of service and separates from service due to\nhealth problems preventing him from engaging in any remunerated work\nshall receive invalidity pension for life. As per the Pension Proclamation, these are the requirements that need to be met\nin order to be eligible for a pension payment.",

    "text": "An employee who satisfies the\nabove requirements will be eligible for a pension payment immediately at the\ntime of separation, thereby being denied the collection of severance payment on\ntop of the pension payment. At this juncture, there is a need to pin point the distinction between “eligibility\nfor pension payment” and “eligibility for pension”. Eligibility for pension\npayment means the pension right has already matured and the pensioner is\nentitled to pension payment immediately at the time of termination. However, eligibility for pension means the candidate has a pension right, but the\nright has not yet matured. For instance, an employee who has completed at least\ntwenty years of service and separates from the service by voluntary resignation\nis entitled to a pension. But that worker’s pension will be payable not\nimmediately but upon attaining sixty years of age. This means if the employee\nresigns after twenty years’ service at the age of fifty-five, the employee has to\nwait for five years before the pension payment matures. Therefore, the one who\n137\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nis eligible for pension payment is not a beneficiary of a severance payment\nwhereas the one who is eligible for pension actually is entitled to severance\npayment. If the terminated employee has completed their probation period and is not\neligible for a pension payment, the next step will be to identify whether the\nworker’s termination is associated with one of the grounds of termination\nmentioned above (Article 39 (1)(a-i). If not, entitlement for severance pay does\nnot exist. Assuming that eligibility for severance pay is affirmatively determined,\nthe next step would be calculating its amount. The relevance of Article 39(1) is\nlimited to determining whether the right to severance pay exists or not. In\ndetermining the extent (amount) of severance pay, however, Article 40 of the\nlabour proclamation is the pertinent provision. Problem for discussion:\nThe grounds of termination provided under Article 39(1) are drawn from\nArticles 24-32 of the Labour Proclamation. But all grounds of termination in\nthose articles are not found under Article 39(1). This means some grounds of\ntermination are not eligible for severance payment. Please identify those\nexcluded grounds; and think of the possible reasons for their exclusion. Article 40: Amount of Severance Payment\n1.",

    "text": "139\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nAs can be seen from the above provisions, though the maximum ceiling of severance\npay both under the labour and civil service regimes is the same, the pay for the first\nyear of service is more generous for the civil service (i.e. three months’ salary) than the\nlabour employment regime (i.e. one month wage). Problem for discussion:\nThe main purpose of granting severance pay in both the labour and civil service\nemployment cases is mainly to minimize the adverse impact of job losses to the\nemployees who may not have a pension benefit at the time of termination. If\nso, why did the legislature decide to adopt a different standard in this regard;\npaying one month’s wage for the first year of service in the private labour\nmarket whereas paying three month’s wages for the first year of service in the\ncivil service regime of employment? Even if such a different standard is\njustified, why should it be limited then to the first year of service only? The other entitlement available to lawfully terminated employees on some\ngrounds is payment in the form of an additional compensation. This entitlement\nemanates from two grounds of termination. One of them is the additional\nseverance pay available to employees whose contracts of employment come to an\nend by virtue of Articles 24(4) or 29. This is stipulated under Article 40(4) of the\nLabour Proclamation. Termination based on Article 24(4) is a termination that\noccurs when the enterprise ceases operation permanently due to bankruptcy or\nfor any other cause; while termination pursuant to Article 29 is a termination\nassociated with reduction of labour force. It can be said that both grounds are\nsituations attributable to the enterprise; and this seems why the employee is\nentitled to additional pay. The amount payable under this heading is an amount\nequal to the worker’s average daily wage of the last week of service multiplied by\n60. Technically, the payable amount under this part is two months’ wage. There is another modality of compensation available for employees who resigned\nfrom employment because of the fact that the employee has been a victim of\n140\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nsexual harassment or sexual violence by the employer or a managerial employee\n(Article 32(1)(b). The amount of compensation under this heading is the\nemployee’s daily wage multiplied by ninety (Article 41(2).",

    "text": "Finally the other form of compensation is one month’s wage compensation which\nis available to an employee who terminates their contract of employment because\nof the fact that the employer has committed any act contrary to human dignity\nand morals or other acts punishable under the Criminal Law (Article 32(1)(a); or\nwhere the termination was initiated on safety grounds where imminent danger\nthreatening the worker’s safety or health occurs and where the employer, having\nbeen made aware of such danger, failed to act within the time limit in accordance\nwith the early warning given by the competent authority or appropriate trade\nunion or the worker himself to avert the danger(Article 32(1)(c); or where the\nemployer has repeatedly failed to fulfil his basic obligations towards the worker\nas prescribed under the Labour Proclamation, collective agreement, work rules\nor other relevant laws and the worker was initiated to resign as a result of this\n(Article 32(1)(d). It is important to note also that the compensation under this\nArticle is payable to a worker who is even eligible for pension payment, because\nthis has a type of punitive and deterrent effect. In Red Fox Ethio Plc v. Jalene Getachew (File No.11757; Vol.19) case, the\nemployee resigned alleging that she was compelled to work in a dangerous\nsituation to her life and health. Thereafter she instituted an action against the\nemployer claiming severance payment and compensation associated with\nresignation without notice. The defendant argued that since she resigned on her\nown initiative, she is not entitled to any compensation whatsoever. The Cassation\nDivision, however, ruled that she is entitled to the payment though she resigned\non her own volition. - Time limit within which the payments should be effected or claimed\nThe fact that monetary entitlements are available to the terminated employee is\nnot beneficial unless those entitlements are payable as soon as possible. The\n141\nTermination of Contract of Employment\neconomic gaps associated with job loss need to be filled soon. With this purpose\nin view, the labour proclamation stipulated that where a contract of employment\nis terminated, wages and other payments connected with the termination due to\nthe worker shall be paid within seven working days from the date of termination\n(Article 36). In our view, payments connected with the termination due to the\nworker is intended to mean payments such as unpaid wages, bonuses, severance\npay, compensation and unutilized annual leave converted into cash.",

    "text": "If there is a dispute as to the amount payable to the employee in this regard, the\nlaw remedies that by stating that the employer shall pay the worker the admitted\namount within the prescribed period (Article 37) while the amount in dispute\nwill be resolved at a later stage in time by a dispute resolving organ. This means\nthe fact that the worker received, without objection, the admitted amount of\ncompensation does not dispossess him of his right to claim the remaining amount\nowed later, if any. To reinforce this policy of prompt payment, the law has prescribed a penalty in\nstating that where an employer fails to pay the sum due to the worker within the\ntime limit, the labour division of a competent court may order a penalty payment\nof up to three months’ the worker’s wage except where the delay is due to causes\nbeyond the control of the employer (Article 38). One of the reasons for delay in\npayment beyond the control of the employer may be failure of the worker to\ncomplete her clearance process by giving back tools and other property entrusted\nto her for the job he was assigned (Ethio-telecom v. Tigist Mulualem et al; File\nNo.74636; Vol:13). In such cases, payment could be justifiably delayed. In this connection, the next issue would be the question of what to do if the\nemployer failed to settle payment within the prescribed payment period. The\navailable remedy will be resorting to court. It is the First Instance Court Labour\nDivision that would have the jurisdiction to entertain such cases (Article 139(1). The time limit within which such claims should be submitted is within six\nmonths from the time of termination (Article 163(4). In addition to the\noutstanding payments, the court can award up to three month’s wages of the\n142\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nemployee, if it is claimed by the employee; and if the court is of the view that\npayment has been unjustifiably delayed (Article 38). 3.3. Unlawful Termination and Its Effects\nUp to now, we have discussed issues associated with lawful termination and its\neffects. Herein below we will examine unlawful terminations together with their\neffects. Broadly, unlawful terminations could be of two types: unlawful due non-\nobservance of procedure (procedural unlawfulness) and unlawful in substance\n(substantive unlawfulness). Procedural unlawfulness denotes a situation where\nthe employer or the employee has a valid reason for termination but failed to\nfollow the legally prescribed procedure of termination.",

    "text": "For instance, the\nemployer may have a valid reason to terminate by giving notice but it failed to\ngive notice and terminated the employee immediately. Similarly, the employee\nis authorized by law to terminate a contractual engagement by giving one-month\nprior notice, but then that employee later decides to leave the job without giving\nadvance notice to the employer. As far as the law is concerned, these all are\nunlawful measures due to non-compliance with procedure. Conversely, substantive unlawfulness relates to the situation where the employer\nterminates the contract of employment without having a valid reason. For\nexample, an employer terminates an employee without notice, alleging that the\nlatter has committed a serious misdeed at the workplace, but the employer has\nno convincing evidence to substantiate the alleged misdeed. Or the employer has\nreduced its labour force without having sufficient ground for a lay off. These are\nall substantively unlawful measures. Although both of the above are unlawful measures, the law has treated them\ndifferently in terms of effect. Procedural unlawfulness is accorded less seriousness\nin the sense that it is procedural and can be remedied through compensation. For\ninstance, if the employee was not given due notice at the time of termination,\nnon-compliance by the employer with the notice requirements shall only result\nin the payment by the employer, wages in lieu of the notice period (Article 44). 143\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nIt is to be recalled that length of notice period available to each employee is to be\ndetermined pursuant to Article 35 and hence the compensation is to be assessed\nin that light. Therefore, the employee terminated in such circumstances cannot\nclaim reinstatement or other compensatory claims. From the employee’s\nperspective as well, if the employee failed to provide advance notice upon\nresigning, he shall be liable to pay compensation to the employer. However, the\ncompensation payable by the worker shall not exceed 30 days’ wages of the\nworker and be payable from the remaining payment due to the worker (Article\n45). When it comes to substantive unlawfulness, however, the situation is different. Basically, substantive unlawfulness may be divided into two categories: the first\nis the so-called termination on “invalid (prohibited) grounds”; while the second\ncould be termed as other substantive grounds. The law creates a distinction in\ngiving effect between the two.",

    "text": "While Article 26(1) of the Labour Proclamation\nsets forth the principle that the employment of a worker may only be terminated\non the grounds mentioned thereunder, Sub-Article (2) of the same provision\nprovides certain reasons which do not constitute valid reasons for termination. Let us examine these. Article 26: General\n1) A contract of employment may only be terminated where there are\ngrounds attributed to the worker’s conduct or with objective\ncircumstances arising from his ability to do his work or the organizational\nor operational requirements of the undertaking. 2) The following shall not be deemed to constitute legitimate grounds for\nthe termination of a contract of employment:\na) Membership of the worker in a trade union or his participation in its\nlawful activities;\nb) Seeking of holding office as a workers’ representative;\n144\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nc) Submission of grievance by the worker against the employer or his\nparticipation in judicial or other proceedings;\nd) The workers’ nationality, sex, religion, political outlook, marital\nstatus, race, colour, family responsibility, pregnancy, disablement or\nsocial status. Similar prohibition and protection have been enshrined under ILO\nConvention No.158, Articles 4 and 5 (Termination of Employment\nConvention; ratified in 1991 by Ethiopia). Protection against some of the\ninvalid reasons for termination included reflects the protection laid down\nin a number of ILO instruments. The ILO Committee has considered the\nprotection provided by these instruments and their application in its\nrecent general surveys on freedom of association workers with family\nresponsibilities and equality in employment and occupation. A\nconsiderable number of countries protect workers against termination of\nemployment for one or more of the reasons mentioned generally by\nmeans of legislation. This is the case both in countries that require\ntermination of employment to be justified and in those where there is no\nrequirement for justification. These forms of protection are usually\nincluded in more far-reaching policies intended to guarantee, for\nexample, trade union rights, a comprehensive system of workers’\nrepresentation within enterprise, the right to claim protection under\nlegislation governing work and employment, and equality of treatment. Some of these guarantees were instituted even before protection against\nunjustified termination of employment was incorporated into the\nlegislation. Trade union membership and participation in trade union activities\nconstitute one of the most common invalid reasons for termination of\nemployment.",

    "text": "The protection afforded to workers and trade union officials\nagainst acts of anti-union discrimination constitutes an essential aspect of\n145\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nfreedom of association, as acts of this nature may result in practice in a\ndenial of the guarantees laid down in the Freedom of Association and\nProtection of the Right to Organize Convention, No.87. Legislation sometimes guarantees protection against acts of anti-union\ndiscrimination, including termination of employment relationship. Some\nlegislation grants special protection to certain persons, such as the\nmembers of a trade union that has applied for registration or that is in the\nprocess of being established, the founders of a trade union, or trade union\nleaders and officers. Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination,\nand in particular termination of employment for such activities, is\nparticularly necessary for trade union leaders and representatives, since\nin order to be able to fulfil their duties freely and independently they\nmust have the guarantee that they will not suffer any prejudice as a result\nof holding trade union office or taking up trade union activities. One way\nof ensuring the protection of trade union representatives is to stipulate\nthat their employment may not be terminated either during their term of\noffice or for a certain period of time following its expiry. While some\nexceptions may be laid down for cases of serious misconduct, the nature\nand the importance of the duties performed by a trade union\nrepresentative and the demands of this kind of office should be taken into\naccount when deciding whether an offence has really been committed\nand when determining how serious it is. Submission of a grievance by the worker against the employer or his\nparticipation in judicial or other proceedings is also an invalid reason for\ntermination of employment. This is an important aspect of employment\nsecurity as it provides protection for workers against retaliatory measures. In its General Surveys on equal remuneration and on equality in\nemployment and occupation, the Committee emphasized this point with\nrespect to rights in the fields of equal remuneration and equality of\nopportunity and treatment. Protection of this kind can be established\nthrough provisions to protect workers against retaliatory measures when\n146\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nthey try to defend their rights. Thus in a growing number of countries\nthere are legal provisions to protect a worker against retaliatory measures\nshould the worker report, for example, working conditions that fail to\nmeet standards set by law, discriminatory practices in employment or\nnon-compliance with occupational safety and health provisions.",

    "text": "In the General Survey on equality in employment and occupation, the\nCommittee emphasized more specifically that the effective protection of\nthe principle of equality presupposes the existence of guarantees\nproviding protection against retaliatory measures for a person who lodges\na complaint with the appropriate body, who institutes proceedings to\nenforce his or her rights, or who is a party to such proceedings as a\nwitness. Such measures, the most severe form of which is termination of\nemployment, taken against a person who has suffered discrimination and\nwho has availed himself of a right which is his in accordance with the\nnational policy of equal opportunity and treatment, are of a particularly\nserious nature and can have detrimental effects with regard to the\npractical application of anti-discriminatory provisions, as those who have\nsuffered discrimination often hesitate to have recourse to procedures to\nredress their grievances for fear of reprisals. The Committee also\nemphasizes the seriousness of retaliatory measures, in particular in the\nform of termination of employment, taken against a worker who reports\nthe employer’s failure to apply occupational safety and health rules while\nthe workers’ physical integrity, health, and even lives may be at risk. ILO (1995) Protection against Unjustified Dismissal: Geneva\nThe remedy available for an employee who was terminated based on any of the\ngrounds mentioned under Article 26(2) would be reinstatement to her previous\nemployment position. This is explicitly stated under Article 43(1) of the Labour\nProclamation. Thus, the remedy is legislatively determined and the tribunal has\n147\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nnot much flexibility in this regard. It is only when the employee does not want\nto be reinstated that she may be compensated and separated because requiring\nreinstatement against the will of the employee would be tantamount to forced\nlabour. In fact, during the Civil Code era where compensation was the sole remedy for\nunlawful termination, in a certain case where a president of a Labour Union was\ndismissed because of his membership in the union, a decision by the Labour\nRelations Board, holding that the dismissal was illegal and ordering reinstatement\nof said worker, was upheld by the Supreme Imperial Court (Sera Mikael Brick\nFactory v. The Association of Demissie Eshete et al; Journal of Ethiopian Law:\nVol.3). Furthermore, Proclamation No.210/1963, had clear provisions prohibiting\nanti-union discrimination (Article 30). These tended to show that anti-union\ndiscrimination was given special attention at the time.",

    "text": "Be that as it may, in addition to reinstatement, if the tribunal found it appropriate,\nit may award a back pay amounting to a maximum of six months wage of the\nemployee. No matter how long the litigation might have taken, the First Instance\nCourt Labour Division is only empowered to award a maximum of the specified\namount (Article 43(5). It seems that the law is of the view that an employer\ncannot be held accountable for the delay and inefficiency of the justice system\nbecause the law has already put a maximum of six months period within which\na labour dispute is to be resolved (Article 139). For other terminations which are held substantively unlawful, the remedy\navailable to the employee is either reinstatement or compensation. The labour\ntribunals decide these matters on a case-by-case basis. However, it is important\nto stress that the tribunal is not at full liberty to award either of the remedies. The law has laid down the parameters. Accordingly, it is stipulated that the\nlabour tribunal may affirm the termination of the worker upon payment of\ncompensation even if the worker requests reinstatement where the tribunal is of\nthe view that the maintenance of the particular worker and employer relations,\n148\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nby its nature or due to the controversy of the parties concerned, is likely to give\nserious difficulties (Article 43(3). Therefore, based on this broad framework, the labour tribunal is entrusted with\na margin of flexibility in determining, on case-by-case basis, as to whether to\naward reinstatement or affirm the termination and compensate the employee\ninstead. Judicial records have shown that courts have had difficulties in\ndetermining which the appropriate remedy is in a particular case. In a case\nbetween Gosh and Ergib medium level transport service and Tessema Hailu (File\nNo.49931; Vol.9), though the employer contended that serious difficulties in\nemployer and employee relations would be created if the employee was\nreinstated, the Cassation Division held that compensation instead of\nreinstatement would not be awarded just because of the mere fact that the\nemployer objected to the reinstatement. Similarly, in the Abjata Soda Ash Share\nCompany v. Martha Abebe case (File No.82336; Vol.14) case, the Cassation\nDivision held that the fact that the employer and the employee were litigating\nagainst each other before the Court did not necessarily mean that serious\ndifficulties in their employment relations would be created thereafter.",

    "text": "Conversely in Selam Technical and Vocation Training Centre v. Kebede Seifu\n(File No.37454; Vol.8), the court refused to order reinstatement. There, Ato\nKebede was a security guard of the Training Centre, and a labour dispute arose\nbetween the two. Ato Kebede asserted that he was unlawfully terminated and\nrequested reinstatement. Although the Cassation Division accepted that the\ntermination was indeed unlawful, it awarded compensation instead of\nreinstatement. Its reason for such a holding was that the employment\nrelationship between an employer and its security guards is based on utmost trust\nand confidence; litigation between them may significantly erode such a\nconfidence and hence reinstating security guard post litigation is unwarranted. In Ethiopian Electric Corporation v. Getnet Mekonnen case (File No. 64079;\nVol.11) Getnet was an employee, a bill collector, of the Corporation and was\ndismissed on disciplinary grounds. The employee took his case to court alleging\n149\nTermination of Contract of Employment\nthat the disciplinary measure was taken after the expiry of the thirty working\ndays period. The reason for this contention was that Article 27(3) stipulates that\nthe right of an employer to terminate contract of employment on disciplinary\ngrounds shall lapse after thirty working days from the date the employer knew\nthe existence of a ground for the termination. The Cassation Division held that\nthe fact that the disciplinary measure was taken after the expiry of the thirty\nworking days from the date the employer knew of the misdeed made the\ndisciplinary measure unlawful. But it opted for compensating the employee\nrather than reinstating him. The next issue would be if the employee is to be compensated rather than\nreinstated, how much is the compensation needs to be determined. This will take\nus to consulting Article 43(4). Let us reproduce it hereunder. Article 43(4)\nThe compensation to be paid to a worker who is not reinstated shall, in addition to\nthe severance pay, be:\na) In case of a contract of employment for an indefinite period, 180 times the\naverage daily wages and a sum equal to his wage for the appropriate notice\nperiod in accordance with Article 44 of this Proclamation;\nb) In case of a contract of employment for a definite period or for piecework, a\nsum equal to the wages he would have obtained if the contract of\nemployment has continued up to its date of expiry or completion of the work;\nprovided, however, that such compensation shall not exceed 180 times his\naverage daily wage.",

He was a very diligent employee who has never taken\nannual leave in his tenure of employment. He received promotions during his\ntime of employment. Since 2016, he has been earning Birr 12,000 per month. His company had no pension scheme arrangement. He received a termination\nletter from his employer last month for alleged incompetence. Being\ndisappointed on receiving the letter of termination, he instituted an action\nagainst Zebul for reinstatement or payments as per the Labour Law. The labour tribunal after examining the case found that the termination was\nin fact unlawful. However, it did consider that reinstating Asfaw would create\ndifficulty in the parties’ future employer and employee relationship. It thus\nheld that awarding cash entitlements would be preferred than reinstatement. Please calculate the liquidated amount Asfaw would be entitled to. In addition to payment of compensation, employers who undertook unlawful\ntermination are liable to additional penalties as well. Pursuant to Article 14(1)(c)\nof the labour proclamation, it is unlawful for an employer “to terminate a contract\nof employment contrary to the provision of this Proclamation.” Moreover,\nArticle 185(2)(c) stipulates that an employer who violates the provisions of\nArticle 14(1) of the proclamation shall by taking into account its economic and\norganizational standing and the manner the fault was committed will be fined:\n- from Birr 10,000 up to Birr 20,000 if the violation is committed for the first time;\n- from Birr 20,000 up to Birr 40,00 if it is committed for the second time; and\n- from Birr 40,000 up to 60,000 if it is committed for the third time. 151\nTermination of Contract of Employment\n- If the act is committed more than three times it may result in closure of the\nundertaking.",

However, the\nlabour inspection service in Ethiopia is too ill-equipped and understaffed to\nhandle such cases. Finally, it is worth considering the time within which an employee may\nchallenge the unlawful termination. Normally, employees who consider that\nthey are unlawfully terminated would like to claim for reinstatement. Therefore,\npursuant to Article 163(2) any claim by a worker to be reinstated shall be barred\nafter three months from the date of termination of the contract of employment. If their claim is for compensation instead of reinstatement, the action should be\nbrought within six month. Hence, it is advisable that the employee act as\npromptly as possible. In another note, unlike lawful termination where severance payment and\npension may not be payable at the same time, for unlawful termination cases, an\nemployee who is unlawfully terminated and who may not be reinstated shall be\nentitled both to severance payment and pension benefit. It must be noted, however, that these all payments associated with lawful and\nunlawful terminations, except the pension benefit, are taxable incomes (Oromia\nRoad Authority v. Birkessa Ibrahim; File No.61 549: Vol.13 and Ayele Mengistu\nv. Ethiopian Cereal Trading Enterprise; File No. 101040; Vol.17)\n152\nChapter IV\nSpecial Groups of Employees\n4.1. General\nIn the preceding chapters, we outlined the key points about employment\nrelations: the rights and duties of the parties; and how this relation could be put\nto an end. Conventionally, employment law is ordinarily designed to be\napplicable to all categories of employees without any distinction. The rights,\nbenefits and obligations under any relevant legislation will be horizontally and\neven-handedly applicable to all employees. An application contrary to this will\nbe discriminatory and actionable.",

    "text": "However, it is common also to see employment\nlegislations of general application contain separate chapters or sections governing\nthe working condition of special groups of employees. In this chapter we will\nexamine the so called “special groups of employees.” For the purpose of this text,\nthese are: probationary employees, young employees, women employees,\nemployees with disabilities, and foreign employees. Although these employees are regulated by the rights and duties provided to all\nother employees under the labour law; in some respects, the law treats them\ndifferently due to various policy reasons. In a sense they are to be differently\ntreated with respect to some employment conditions. Hence, the purpose of this\nchapter will be highlighting special conditions of work and treatments accorded\nto such groups of employees. The reasons for such differential, mainly preferential, treatment, differ from one\ngroup to another. At times, it is because of the status of their employment. Differential treatment for young employees and women employees is dictated by\nphysical and mental tenderness and maternity issues respectively. Young\nemployees, being in possession of tender physical and mental condition, are\nvulnerable to multiple risks at workplaces. Women employees, as well, are\nsubject to employment discrimination that arises from stereotypes about gender\n153\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nroles and sexual harassment in workplaces. The same logic and reasoning is\napplicable with respect to employees with disabilities, too. With respect to employees on probation and foreign employees, their treatment\nis mostly associated with their status. The status of being in a trial period; and the\nstatus of being non-Ethiopian may bring about certain limitations in the exercise\nof employment rights. This is mainly dictated by policy considerations. Herein\nbelow, we will examine the nature and the manner of their treatments one by\none. 4.2. Probationary Employees\nAt the commencement of a contract of employment, the employer is entitled to\nset a probationary period (i.e. trial period). The main purpose of probation is to\ntest the suitability of the employee to a post to which she is intended to be\nassigned. Suitability for employment could be assessed in light of different\nparameters, such as; competence, duty mindedness, human relations,\npunctuality, discipline and integrity. Within the probation period, the employer\nis authorized to dismiss the employee without any procedure if the employer is\nof the view that the employee is unfit for the post. A worker on probation may\nterminate her contract of employment without notice as well.",

    "text": "It is argued that “whenever a person is dismissed for unfitness, it is sufficient that\nthe employer honestly believes on reasonable grounds that the person is unfit.” Hence, this period is a time when an employee has no secured job position. If the\nemployee continues to work after the expiry of the probation period, the\nemployee shall be deemed to have successfully completed their probation period\nand be tasked in accordance with the contract of employment. As a result,\nemployees would like to have a short probation period while employers would\nprefer to have a long probation period in order to possess wider flexibility to\nretain or terminate employees at liberty. Historically, under the Civil Code employment regime, whether a probationary\nperiod would exist and the length thereof was left to the contracting parties\n154\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n(Article 2598). However, according to the Civil Code, “where the probation\nperiod was fixed for a minimum time, the right to terminate the contract was not\nto be exercised before that minimum time has elapsed” (Article 2600(1). Labour\nProclamation No.64/1975, introduced a maximum cap to the duration of\nprobation period. It was stipulated that the probation period of any worker shall\nnot exceed ninety days (Article 9(1). Though the parties may agree to have\nprobation period, they can by no means fix it to exceed ninety days commencing\nfrom the date of employment. This law did not require any formality for the\nincorporation of a probation period in the sense that the first ninety days of\nemployment may be held as probation periods even in the absence of special\nform. By virtue of the Labour Proclamation No.42/1993, two changes were introduced. First, the maximum duration of probation period was lowered to forty-five\n(consecutive) days. Second, if the parties agree to have probation period, they\nshould put it in writing; otherwise, it was considered as though there was no\nprobation period in the contract of employment. In fact, in Berhe Hagos General\nContractors v. Ato Gemechu Adugna (File No.98052: Vol.16) case, the Cassation\nDivision held that the means to prove the probationary relation is a mutually\nagreed and signed contract between the parties. In the above case the parties did not expressly state about probation in their\ncontract of employment. However, the same day a letter of employment prepared\nby the employer and received by the employee stated that the first forty-five days\nwould be a probation period.",

    "text": "But the Court held that this is not by itself sufficient\nto prove the existence of probationary employment since it was not mutually\nagreed. A step further, in Elias Bar and Restaurant v. Mirtnesh Atinafu et al, (File\nNo.126667; Vol.22) case, the Cassation Division ruled that a legally binding\nprobationary employment contract should be prepared in written form, signed\nby the parties and attested by two witnesses. 155\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nProblem for discussion:\nDo you agree with the above line of interpretations by the Cassation\nDivision? Why or why not? Does it mean that a contract of probation shall be attested by two witnesses\nin addition to the signature of the parties for its validity? Other than the rigorous formalities for probation, employers’ associations were\nof the view that forty-five days was too short to determine suitability of an\nemployee for the post. Moreover, in their view, the fact that probation period\nwas formulated in terms of consecutive days rather than working days have\ncompounded the problem. Particularly, with industrialization, the labour profile\nwould be more of skilled than unskilled labour. Skilled labour is more complex\nthan the unskilled and semi-skilled labour. Hence, job complexity demands a\nlonger period to determine an employee’s suitability. Industrial parks operators\nwere insisting and pressing for longer probation period. Employers’ associations\nthus proposed the amendment of the Labour Proclamation to the effect that the\nprobation period should be longer than forty-five days; and it should be counted\nin terms of working days, as the employee may only be assessed during working\ndays. The experience of other countries such as Kenya and the Sudan in this\nregard showed that probation period could be fixed as long as six months. The current labour proclamation seemed to have considered the experience of\nother countries and the concerns of the employers’ associations. Currently, the\nmaximum period for probation is sixty working days (Article 11(3); Proc. No.1156/2019). It has been increased from forty-five to a maximum of sixty days\nand it is counted in terms of working days instead of consecutive days. With respect to probation period, it is worth noting that the labour law and the\nCivil Service Proclamation adopt varying positions. Under the Civil Service, a\n156\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nprobation period is mandatory in the sense that every new employee should pass\nthrough the status of provisional appointment (employment).",

    "text": "The length of the\nprobation period for civil service purposes is six months. It can even be extended\nfor another three months in cases where the employee’s performance result is\nbelow average for the first six months. Thus, the probationary period can extend\nas long as nine months. As we have seen above, this is not the case under the\nLabour Proclamation. Problem for discussion:\n1. Under both the Labour Law and the Civil Service employment regime, the\nprobation period serves to determine fitness (suitability) to the anticipated job\nposition. To this effect, the Labour Proclamation stipulates that “a worker may\nbe employed for a probation period for purpose of testing his suitability to a\njob position in which he is anticipated to hold” (Article 11(1); while the Civil\nServants Proclamation prescribes “the purpose of probation shall be to prove\nthe competence of a newly appointed civil servant through follow-up of his\nperformance” (Article 19(1). If so, what explanation could be offered for\nadopting differing lengths of probation for the civil service and for the labour\nlaw one? Should this harmonized? 2. What happens if the contracting parties agree for longer probation period\nthan what has been provided under the Labour Proclamation as a legal\nmaximum? Should the contract of employment be nullified? Or should the\nterm of the contract specifying probation period be nullified? Or should only\nthe terms of the contract of employment on probation period be replaced by\nthe legal maximum? Explain your reasons. 4.3. Young Workers\nProhibition of abusive child labour employment has been one of the focus areas\nof ILO since its inception. One of such efforts was the adoption of the first\n157\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nConvention on age of employment in 1919 (the Minimum Age (Industry)\nConvention, 1919 (No.5)). Article 2 of the convention states that children under\nthe age of fourteen years shall not be employed. This effort was followed by\nadoption of a series of binding standards focusing on specialized economic\nactivities and subject matters such as sectors like the non-industrial, sea,\nagriculture, fishermen, underground work and night work employments. Finally,\nin 1973 ILO devised a general legal framework, consolidating all of its previous\nefforts and documents into a single and universally applicable rules on minimum\nage of employment in any occupation (The Minimum Age Convention, 1973\n(No.138)).",

    "text": "Behind all such efforts of the ILO and its member states were the\neffective abolition of child labour and to raise progressively the minimum age for\nadmission to employment (Article 1). The provisions have as one of their goals\nthe enhancement of the children’s rights to education. After recognizing the national policy for countries in exceptional situations, the\n1973 convention prescribes that the minimum age to be specified for admission\ninto the employment or work in any occupation shall not be less than the age of\ncompletion of compulsory schooling, and in any case, shall not be less than fifteen\nyears (Article 2). The convention also permits a limited exception for developing\nor underdeveloped countries to initially fix the age at fourteen years. However,\nfor work which by its nature is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or morals of\nyoung persons, the minimum age shall not be less than eighteen years (Article 3). The detail types and nature of such occupations are left to be determined by\nnational laws of member states. Ethiopia has ratified and incorporated into its laws the terms and obligations of\nConvention No. 138 since 27 May 1999. In addition, the country has also accepted\nother important conventions in the area, including, the Convention on the Rights\nof the Child, 1989 (CRC) and Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour,\n1999 (No.182). The above binding instruments together with other UN and\nAfrican treaty regimes form the largest packages for protection of the right of\nchildren in general and from employment related violations in particular. These\n158\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nall instruments are ratified by Ethiopia and have become integral parts of the law\nof the country. Article 32 of the CRC protects children from economic exploitation and from\nperforming work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s\neducation, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual,\nmoral or social development. Hence what can be inferred from the above\ninternational standard setting in the area of children’s protection is that\npremature or early engagement or admission of children into employment or\nlabour market may potentially compromise some of the fundamental rights of\nchildren legally protected within other international treaties such as the right to\neducation, the right to development and survival, the right to physical, mental\nand social development, the right to rest and leisure.",

    "text": "Ethiopia has adopted a series of laws protecting the rights and interests of\nchildren and laws regulating admission of young persons into formal employment\nor labour market in the country. These include: the FDRE Constitution, family\ncodes at federal and regional levels, the Criminal Code, and various types and\nlevels of employment legislations and binding decisions of the Cassation Division. To begin with, the FDRE Constitution clearly protects every child from\nexploitative practices or works which may be hazardous or harmful to his/her\neducation, health or well-being (Article 36(1)(d)). The FDRE Criminal Code of\n2004 on the other hand penalizes those acts of maltreatment of minors which\nmay comprise over-work capable of causing injury to the health, well-being,\neducation or physical or psychological development of the minor (Article 576). Of course, premature engagement of minors in the workplace may potentially\nbring about one or more of the above-mentioned impacts and hence resulting in\ncriminal accountability of the person in custodial responsibility. In the Ethiopian context, in principle, persons below the age of 18 are minors;\nand owing to their status of minority, they are not allowed to enter into juridical\nacts directly and personally. As we all know, entering into a contract of\nemployment is a juridical act. However, the private sector employment regime\n159\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nallows individuals who attained the age of fifteen to enter into a contract of\nemployment. For purposes of Ethiopian labour law, “young worker” means “a\nnatural person who has attained the age of fifteen but is below the age of eighteen\nyears” (Article 89(1). Hence, the minimum age of employability and the age of\nmajority do not coincide. It must thus be noted that the issue of employment of\nyoung employees is an exception to the general rule of the law of contract. As the\nlaw now stands, employment below the age of fifteen is prohibited; while\nemployment between the age of fifteen and eighteen is rigorously regulated. Consequently, for the first time in Ethiopian labour history detailed regulation\nfor young workers was introduced in 1966. Pursuant to Labour Standards\nProclamation No.232/1966, it is provided that “no person under fourteen years of\nage shall be employed in industrial enterprises in which persons other than\nmembers of his immediate family are employed” (Article 13(1).",

Relevant legislations subsequent to 1966 have not\nbeen as detailed as the 1966 instrument. For instance, Labour Proclamation\nNo.64/1975 merely prohibited the employment of persons under fourteen years\nof age (Article 30(2); whereas it had forbidden employers to require young\nworkers work after 10.00p.m. or to engage them in dangerous trades (Article\n30(4). Young worker as defined by the same instrument was to mean “a worker\nwho is above fourteen but less than eighteen years of age” (Article 2(28). Unlike the 1966 law where it required the written consent of a parent or guardian\nfor a young worker to engage in employment, Proclamation No.64/1975 seemed\nto have avoided that requirement. It provided that “notwithstanding the\nprovisions of the Civil Code, persons who have attained fourteen years of age and\nabove, may enter into a contract” (Article 6). Since Labour Standards\nProclamation No.232/1966 was repealed by Proclamation No.64/1975, it is to be\nimplied that requirement was avoided. Be this as it may, under the current law, young employees, who are employees\nwithin the age range between fifteen and eighteen, owing to their tender age and\nphysical condition are treated differently under the labour law. Their differential\nand preferential treatment is targeted towards their protection and is manifested\nin the following terms of employment. a) As regards to length of working hours and its timing:\n­ Normal working hours for young employees would be seven hours per day\nwhile for adult employees normal working hours is eight hours per day\n(Article 61 (1) and 90);\n­ It is prohibited to employ young employees on:\n- Night work (i.e. between 10 p.m.-6 a.m.)\n­ Over-time work\n161\nSpecial Groups of Employees\n­ Weekly rest days\n­ Public holidays; adults do not have such restrictions. b) As regards to types of work: Unlike the previous instruments\n(Proclamations No.232/1966 and Proclamation No.64/1975) which employ\nthe generic phrase “dangerous trades”; it lists out activities that are\nconsidered to be “dangerous trades” to young employees;\n­ No employment for young workers in the transporting of passengers and\ngoods by road, rail air and internal water;\n­ No employment for young workers in dock sides and warehouses involving\nheavy lifting;\n­ No employment for young workers in electric power generation and\ntransmission lines;\n­ No employment for young workers in underground works (such as mines\nand quarries)\n­ No employment for young workers in sewerage systems and digging\ntunnels.",

    "text": "Furthermore, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs has been empowered to\nissue directives which incorporate lists of activities prohibited for young workers\n(Article 89(4). Accordingly, the Ministry issued such a directive in 2013 that\ndetailed the prohibited tasks to young employees, which were broadly\nformulated by the Labour Proclamation. The Civil Service Proclamation, in principle, prohibits civil service employment\nbelow the age of majority (i.e. eighteen years of age). It, nevertheless, promises\nto come up with the Federal Civil Service Agency’s Directive on how persons\nbelow the age of majority will be employed as civil servants (Article 14(2)). However, the anticipated directive is not yet put in place. 162\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nProblem for discussion:\nIt is frequently argued that child labour is mainly associated with poverty. Ideally childhood is to be allocated for primary education. But in\nimpoverished societies like Ethiopia, few and poor educational facilities do\nnot provide access to all children. Thus, for many children in such\nsocieties, their fate would be to either join the labour market or to be idle. As a result, many contend that it is preferable to find children in the labour\nmarket rather than in the streets. Some even raise the issue that placing\nsuch restrictions on youth would not be relevant to the Ethiopian reality\nwhere a child needs to produce in order to feed him/herself or starve to\ndeath. Are the child labour standards based on a developed world standard\n(i.e. euro-centric) rather than on the Ethiopian reality? Or are these\nrelevant instruments applicable to Ethiopian society as well? Problem for consideration:\nEthiopia has already ratified a sufficient number of international\ninstruments on human and child rights in general that concern the age of\nadmission into employment and the eradication of child labour in\nparticular. However, studies indicate that the prevalence of engagement of\nchildren in formal labour market is among the highest in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica and there is not much indication that this figure will change soon. One of the challenges in the enforcement of legal age of admission into\nemployment is the overall poverty and underdevelopment of a nation’s\neconomy. The other limitation is the absence of effective registration at\nbirth which makes enforcement of the laws challenging. Critically discuss\nhow Ethiopia can tackle such continuing challenges in enforcing its treaty\ncommitments and effectively eliminating child labour in the country. 163\nSpecial Groups of Employees\n4.4.",

    "text": "Women Workers\nAccording to the ILO, maternity is a condition which requires differential\ntreatment to achieve genuine equality and, in this sense, it is more of a premise\nof the principle of equality than a dispensation. Special maternity protection\nmeasures should be taken to enable women fulfil their maternal role without\nbeing marginalized in the labour market. Distinction based on sex are those which use the biological characteristics and\nfunctions that differentiate men from women. Such distinction includes those\nestablished explicitly or implicitly, to the disadvantage of one sex or the other. Women are commonly affected, especially in the case of indirect discrimination,\nby these distinctions, which stem from traditional attitudes that still persist\nstrongly in certain societies such as Ethiopia. Many traditional cultural attitudes\nin society tend to discriminate against women in many respects. As a\nmanifestation of these discriminatory practices, women workers’ share in the\nformal labour market in many developing countries, such as Ethiopia, has been\nless visible compared to their number in society. In order to do away with such inequitable outcome, modern legal systems have\nalready incorporated the principle of “non-discrimination on the basis of sex” in\ntheir basic laws and practices. However, a distinction must be made between\ndirect sex discrimination, where the sex or gender of the work is taken as the\ndecisive criterion for unequal treatment, and indirect sex discrimination, where\nunequal treatment is based on another criterion seemingly neutral to sex, but\nwhere the negative implications mainly affect persons of a specific sex. Equal treatment though necessary is not sufficient to attain equality. The historic\nlegacy of discrimination needs to be addressed and rectified as well. Thus, in\norder to bring about equality and equity, the principle of non-discrimination\nmust be complimented by another equally relevant principle, which is termed as\n“affirmative action.” Unless and until these two principles are reinforced to each\nother, past misdeeds and previous marginalization may not be rectified and\nthereby true equality will not be attained. 164\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nThe Ethiopian Constitution takes note of this historical legacy of discrimination\nand has attempted to address it. It provides as follows:\nArticle 35: Rights of Women\n1. Women shall, in the enjoyment of rights and protections provided for by this\nConstitution, have equal right with men. 2. Women have equal rights with men in marriage as prescribed by this\nconstitution. 3.",

By then maternity leave was one month post-natal leave out of\nwhich only half of it was a paid (Article 2566). Maternity leave has two\nunderlying components; a wage replacement component covering a specified\nnumber of weeks at a specified time; and a job protection aspect during the leave\nperiod. By retaining what has been gained by the Civil Code, the Labour\nStandards Proclamation No.232/1966 further obligated employers “to provide\nequal remuneration for work of equal quality regardless of the sex of the\nemployees” (Article 14). Further maternity protections have been introduced through the medium of\nLabour Proclamation No.64/1975. Post-natal maternity leave was increased to\nforty-five days with full pay (Article 39(2)).",

    "text": "Moreover, it was forbidden to have\npregnant women after 10.00 p.m. or to require them to work over-time (Article\n30(3). Then came Proclamation No. 42/1993 that prolonged maternity leave from\nforty-five days to ninety days with full pay out of which the first thirty days were\npre-natal leave. Therefore, the concept pre-natal leave was brought in by the\n1993 Labour Proclamation. In fact, with the coming into force of the Federal Constitution in 1995, maternity\nleave and other gender-based protections have obtained constitutional\nrecognition as reproduced herein above. Issues of affirmative action, prohibition\nof discriminatory payment and promotion have also been indicated by the\nConstitution. Nevertheless, in practice, in areas such as the construction sector\ndiscriminatory payment based on gender has been prevalent in the country. The current labour law tries to regulate the situation of women employees from\ntwo angles. The first type of regulation is providing flat protection available to all\nwomen employees by virtue of being women. “ Women shall not be discriminated\nagainst as regards employment and payment, on the basis of their sex” (Article 87\n(1).

Based on this, the Ministry has already come up\nwith a directive that incorporates a long list of tasks in which engaging women\nemployees are prohibited due to the risk the tasks may pose to their life, health\nand reproductive system. Problem for discussion:\nSome tend to hold that laying down a long list of prohibited jobs to women\nemployees would adversely affect their visibility in the labour market. In\na society where male supremacy is still intact, such measure could be mis-\nused to marginalize women from economic empowerment. They thus\npropose that let women themselves decide whether to engage in such tasks\nor not. Others are of the view that this will be a dangerous undertaking because\ndue to poverty, women may take risk that would be detrimental to them. They cannot make a well-informed choice since they may not appreciate\nthe health risks involved in each task.",

    "text": "Thus since the government has\nexperts in every field at its disposal to make such determination,\ngovernment’s prescription is desirable and appropriate. Leaving it to\nprivate decision is unwarranted. What do you think? It is worth noting that the current labour proclamation has included issues of\nsexual harassment and sexual violence expressly. This is a new introduction to\nthe Ethiopian employment regulatory frame work. Until recently, these issues\nwere objects of interest to the criminal justice track. Nevertheless, the present\nlabour proclamation defined what “sexual harassment” and “sexual violence” are\n(Article 2(11) and 2(12) and attached sanctions on those who commit or attempt\nto commit these acts at workplaces. The duty to make working condition safe\n167\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nimposed on the employer shall be construed to mean making it safe from sexual\nharassment and/or sexual violence as well. The sanction imposed by the Labour\nProclamation is other than or in addition to what is available under the criminal\njustice track. Within the ILO jurisprudence, the term “sexual harassment” includes any insult\nor inappropriate remark, joke, insinuation and comment on a person’s dress,\nphysique, age, family situation, etc; a condescending or paternalistic attitude with\nsexual implications undermining dignity; any unwelcome  invitation or request,\nimplicit or explicit, whether or not accompanied by threats; any lascivious look\nor other gesture associated with sexuality, and any unnecessary physical contact\nsuch as touching , caresses, pinching or assault. In order to constitute sexual\nharassment in employment, an act of this type must, in addition, be justly\nperceived as a condition of employment or precondition for employment, or\ninfluenced decisions taken in this field, and/or affect job performance. Sexual\nharassment may also arise from situations which are generally hostile to one sex\nor the other. Sexual harassment undermines equality at the workplace by calling into question\nindividual integrity and the well-being of workers; it damages an enterprise by\nweakening the bases upon which work relationships are built and impairing\nproductivity. In view of the gravity and serious repercussions of this practice,\nsome countries are now adopting legislation prohibiting it and making it subject\nto civil and/or criminal penalties. This is similar with what we have in Ethiopia. The other type of regulation is providing special protections for women under\nparticular circumstances such as pregnancy and maternity. No pregnant woman\nshall be assigned to night work between 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. or be assigned on\nover-time work (Article 87(4).",

The civil service regime has legislated\nsimilar protections against discrimination of women in employment, payment\nand promotion as well as provisions enabling for affirmative action. Problem for discussion:\nSome people tend to hold the view that though pregnancy and maternity\nprotections are necessary for women employees, such protections may\nsubstantially reduce their employment opportunity owing to the fact that\nemployer may not be ready to cover the whole expenses associated with\npaid maternity leaves. Historically, maternity leave under the Civil Code\nof 1960 was one month and it was only half of it that was paid (Art.2566). Under Proc. No.64/75 such leave was upgraded to forty-five days and all\nof it was paid leave (Art.39 (2)). With the coming into force of Proc. No.42/93 maternity leave was further increased to three months in\nduration (in the form of pre and post-natal) with full pay (Art.88) and this\nhas been carried forward to Proc. No.377/2003. In fact, Labour\nProclamation No. 1156/2019 prolonged maternity leave to a total of four\nmonths (i.e. one month prenatal and three months post-natal). Similar\nposition has been adopted by the Federal Civil Service Proclamation in this\nrespect (Art.41). Indeed, the Civil Servants’ Proclamation even allows for\naggregation of maternity leave in the sense that what was not utilized as\nprenatal leave could be transferred to post-natal leave. It should be known that family reproduction is to the benefit of the family\nand society at large; if so, shouldn’t the family and society (i.e. the\nhousehold concerned and the state as representative of society) share the\ncost of maternity leave? Why should employers be compelled to single\nhandily cover such expense? Wouldn’t such obligation tend to discourage\nemployers from employing young females who are potentially pregnant?",

    "text": "169\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nA study conducted before around fifteen years ago by Ethiopian Women\nLawyers Association has the following to say: “The fear that is generally\nexpressed is that, even such legitimate special treatment will eventually\nharm women’s interest if the payment of benefits is primarily borne by the\nemployer. Our sample survey showed that 47% of the employers said that\nmaternity leave is very costly and 36% said that society should bear part of\nthe cost. The prevalence of such view amongst employers and their profit\nmotive makes it likely that they may respond by discriminating women of\nchildbearing age outside of their recruitment range”. Is this really a well-founded fear and concern? If so, what type of\nalternative(s), which will have least restrictive effect to women\nemployment opportunity, do you propose? The incentive approach instead\nof the sanction approach? 4.5. Employees with Disabilities\nStudies have verified that over 600 million people worldwide have a physical,\nsensory, intellectual or mental impairment in one form or another. This equals\napproximately 10% of the world’s population. People with disabilities can be\nfound in every country, with over two-thirds of them living in the developing\nworld. Throughout the world there is an undeniable link between disability,\npoverty and exclusion. The denial of employment opportunities to people with\ndisabilities forms one of the root causes of poverty and exclusion of many\nmembers of this group. There is ample evidence that shows people with disabilities are more likely than\nnon-disabled persons to experience disadvantage, exclusion and discrimination\nin the labour market and elsewhere. As a result of these experiences, people with\ndisabilities are disproportionately affected by unemployment. When they work,\nthey can often be found outside of the formal labour market, performing\nuninspiring low-paid and low-skilled jobs, offering little or no opportunities for\n170\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\njob promotion or other forms of career progression. Employees with disabilities\nare often under employed. The issue of disability is one that deserves serious attention in Ethiopia. The level\nof poverty in Ethiopia translates into a lack of health care and treatment for the\ndisabled. For example, a lack of adequate health facilities and vaccination during\npregnancy or childhood are major causes for disability at birth or childhood. Harmful traditional practices will also have their own significant share in this\nrespect.",

    "text": "Absence of tolerance and mutual respect, which resulted in prolonged\ncivil war; and which has been responsible for tribal and at times religious\nconflicts, are also relevant in the equation. Against this background, recent Ethiopian legal instruments have incorporated\nrelevant provisions with a view to widening the employment opportunities of\npersons with disabilities. The FDRE Constitution stipulates, “The State shall,\nwithin available means, allocate resources to provide rehabilitation and assistance\nto the physically and mentally disabled, the aged, and to children who are left\nwithout parents or guardian” (Article 41 (5) emphasis added). Of course it must\nbe admitted that the way the constitutional provision has been formulated tends\nsubscribe to the social welfare model in the sense that disabled persons are to be\nobjects of rehabilitation rather than subjects of employment and production. However, Proclamation No. 568/2008 has brought important provisions for\nemployment of persons with disabilities. The principle of “reasonable\naccommodation” for persons with disabilities has been incorporated in this\nProclamation (Article 6 of the Proclamation). The UN Disability Convention is\nratified by Ethiopia as well. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of\ndisability has also been expressly inserted under the Federal Civil Servants’\nProclamation (Article 13 (1)) and the Labour Proclamation (Article 14 (1) (f)). However, these protections only apply to those disabled individuals who are\nqualified and meet the requirements of the job. For example, a taxi company\nrequiring job applicants to have a driving license excludes visually impaired\npeople as well as people who, due to a medical condition, no longer have a driving\n171\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nlicense. Such a license requirement on the part of the taxi company is legitimate\nand proportionate and therefore constitutes a genuine or justifiable occupational\nrequirement. Prohibition of discrimination against disabled persons though necessary is not\nsufficient for their full admission into the labour market. Affirmative action in\nfavour of disabled persons may need to be introduced with a view to making the\nprotection comprehensive and complete. For instance, in Germany, employers\nboth in the private and public sector who employ more than 16 employees are\nobliged to employ at least 6% handicapped persons. When this obligation is not\nfulfilled the employer has to pay a fine. This sum of money has to be spent\nexclusively on supporting the situation of handicapped persons. Would the German experience be relevant to our case? Why/why not?",

    "text": "Herein below is an extract from “Achieving Equal Employment Opportunities\nfor People with Disabilities through Legislation” (ILO, Guideline: 2007)\nDisability as a human rights issue\nFor a long time, disability was treated primarily as a social welfare issue. This\nreflected the widely held belief that people with disabilities needed care and\nassistance, being unable and incapable of living their own lives. As a corollary,\npeople with disabilities were seen as objects of social welfare and not as subjects\nin their own right, let alone entitled to the full enjoyment of the right to work. Due to their marginalized status in society and resulting invisibility, as well as\nwidespread prejudice, people with disabilities did not fully enjoy their human\nrights, including the right to decent work. The human rights charters and conventions adopted from the mid-1940s to the\nlate 1960s – such as the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights,\n1948, the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, and the\n172\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nUN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 - do not specifically mention\npeople with disabilities. It is only since the 1970s that the disadvantages faced by\ndisabled persons, their social exclusion and discrimination against them were\nincreasingly perceived to constitute a human rights issue. The shift from a social\nwelfare approach to one based on human rights is reflected in explicit reference\nto persons with disabilities in human rights charters, conventions and initiatives\nadopted since the 1980s and in an increasing number of special – and usually non-\nbinding – instruments adopted by such organizations as the UN and the Council\nof Europe. These instruments include the Council of Europe Coherent Policy for\nthe Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities, 1992, and the UN Standard Rules\non the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, 1993. On 19 December 2001, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 56/168\nestablishing an “Ad Hoc Committee, open to the participation of all Member\nStates and observers of the United Nations, to consider proposals for a\ncomprehensive and integral international convention to promote and protect the\nrights and dignity of persons with disability, based on the holistic approach in the\nfield of social development, human rights and non-discrimination and taking into\naccount the recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights and the\nCommission for Social Development.” On the recommendation of the Ad Hoc\nCommittee (AHC) at its Second Meeting in June 2003, a decision was taken to\nproceed with the development of such a convention.",

The UN General Assembly formally adopted the Convention in a vote by\nconsensus on 13 December 2006. Similar shifts from a social welfare to a human rights law approach are taking\nplace on a regional and national level, with an increasing number of existing\nhuman rights instruments being amended, to include the rights of people with\n173\nSpecial Groups of Employees\ndisabilities, and new instruments being adopted, both comprehensive and\ndisability specific. The concept of disability\nWhen legislation is being formulated to eliminate the disadvantages faced by\ndisabled persons, to dismantle the exclusionary mechanisms they face in society,\nand to enhance equal employment opportunities for them, the question arises of\nhow to define the beneficiaries of the legislation. In other words: what constitutes\na disability? In this discussion, two opposing views can be distinguished. On the one hand,\nthere are those who situate the problems of disability in the person concerned,\nwhile paying little or no attention to his or her physical or social environment. This is referred to as the individual or medical model of disability. On the other\nhand, there are those who perceive disability as a social construct: disabilities\nresult from the failure of the physical and social environment to take into account\nthe needs of particular individuals and groups. According to this social model of\ndisability, society creates disabilities by accepting an idealized norm of the\nphysically and mentally perfect person and by organizing society on the basis of\nthis norm. Examples:\nAccording to the individual model of disability, a person with a mobility\nimpairment is disabled as a result of an individual impairment. He or she can try\nto overcome the functional limitations which come along with this by\nundergoing medical or paramedical treatment and/or by using medical or\nparamedical aids, such as a wheelchair or crutches. According to the social model of disability, mobility impairment should be seen\nin the context of the surrounding society and environment. Reducing or\novercoming the limitations on activities and restrictions to participation\nassociated with mobility impairment implies taking away societal barriers, and\n174\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nensuring that the built environment is accessible.",

    "text": "Both the social and individual models of disability have proven to have\nadvantages and constraints, depending on the aim of the legislation. The\nindividual or medical model can be particularly helpful in such fields as\nrehabilitation medicine and social security law, while the social model can be\ninstrumental in tackling the root causes of exclusion, disadvantage and\ndiscrimination. The social model recognizes that the answer to the question of\nwhether a person can be classified as disabled is intrinsically related to such\nfactors as culture, time and environment. Defining disability in legislation\nThe definition of disability, which determines who will be recognized as a person\nwith a disability, and hence protected by the relevant legislation, is very much\ndependent on the goal being pursued by the particular law or policy. Thus, there\nis no single definition of disability which can be used in all labor and social\nlegislation. The two different approaches to definition are as follows. -  wording aimed at a narrow, identifiable beneficiary group. This should be used\nif the aim is to craft laws to provide financial or material support to disabled\nindividuals, or employers of disabled people. A limited, impairment-related\ndefinition of disability (individual model) thereby ensures that support is\ntargeted at those who are most in need. - broadly inclusive wording aimed at protection from discrimination on the\ngrounds of disability. This broader definition of the protected group (social\nmodel) should be used in anti-discrimination laws because many people,\nincluding those with minor disabilities, people associated with people with\ndisabilities and those who are wrongly assumed to have a disability, can be\naffected by disability-based discrimination. 175\nSpecial Groups of Employees\n- Reasonable accommodation\nDisability can sometimes affect an individual’s ability to carry out a job in the\nusual or accustomed way. The obligation to make a reasonable or effective\naccommodation, or the right to be accommodated, is often found in modern\ndisability non-discrimination law. Disability non-discrimination legislation\nincreasingly requires employers and others to take account of an individual’s\ndisability and to make efforts to cater for the needs of a disabled worker or job\napplicant, and to overcome the barriers erected by the physical and social\nenvironment. This obligation is known as the requirement to make a reasonable\naccommodation. The failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to workers\nand job applicants, who face obstacles in the labor market, is not merely a bad\nemployment practice but is increasingly perceived as an unacceptable form of\nemployment discrimination.",

The law should define closely what is meant by reasonable accommodation, so that\nmisinterpretation is avoided and employers clearly understand what they must do. Example:\nIn the United States, the obligation to make a reasonable accommodation is to be\nfound in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990. Reasonable accommodation\nis understood to mean any change in the work environment or in the way a job\nis performed that enables a person with disability to enjoy equal employment\nopportunities. There are three categories of \"reasonable accommodations”:\nchanges to a job application process, changes to the work environment or the way\n176\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\na job is usually done, and changes that enable an employee with a disability to\nenjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment, such as access to training. Other countries, including Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have legal\nprovisions stipulating that the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation\nconstitutes a form of discrimination. The Ethiopian legislation for the Right to Employment for Persons with\nDisability of 2008 defines “a person with disability” as an individual whose equal\nemployment opportunity is reduced as a result of his physical, mental or sensory\nimpairments in relation with social, economic and cultural discrimination.

In some\ncases it may be possible to collect this necessary evidence without difficulty –\nsuch as in the case of recruitment, where advertisements for job vacancies and\nrecruitment materials are easily available. In other cases, involving an action\nwhich is suspected rather than established, it may prove impossible to gather\ncredible evidence. This is true, for example, when the information and records\nthat might constitute evidence are held by the person against whom the claim is\nmade (for example, by an employer in an equal pay case). This person may be\nable to win the case by saying nothing and simply challenging the evidence\nproduced.",

A reversal\nof the burden of proof makes non-discrimination law effective. In 2003, all fifteen countries of the European Union (EU) were required to\nintroduce laws or amendments to their laws or other legal instruments to allow\nfor a reversal of the burden of proof in employment discrimination cases\ninvolving direct or indirect discrimination. All new Member States will also have\nto follow suit. This follows from a European Union law (a directive) adopted by\nthe Council of Ministers in the year 2000. The Directive stipulates that disability\ndiscrimination cases are subject to a reversal of the burden of proof in favour of\nthe employee or job applicant with a disability from 2003 onwards. Similarly, Employment of Persons with Disability Act of Ethiopia (2008) has\nincorporated this principle. It reads as follows:\nArticle 7(1)\nAny person with disability who alleges that discrimination on ground of\ndisability existed with respect to recruitment, promotion, placement, transfer or\nother conditions of employment may institute a suit to the competent court on\nthe issue without the requirement of the burden of proof. Article 7(2)\nThe defendant to a suit instituted pursuant to sub-Article (1) of this article shall\nbe responsible to prove that there was no act of discrimination thereof. Problem for discussion:\nSome tend to argue that disability lies on the society where the disabled\npersons is a member rather than the on the disabled individual. To substantiate\nthis position examples may be offered. For instance, let us think of two visually\nimpaired individuals residing into two different locations of the globe\n(Germany and Ethiopia). The one in Germany is more serviceable, mobile and\nproductive than the one in Ethiopia.",

With the integration of\ncountries into the global economy; and the progressive elimination and reduction\nof tariff and non-tariff barriers, goods have been crossing national borders at\nrelative ease. Through passage of time, however, not only goods but capital,\nservices and people began to cross national borders based on predetermined\nprocedures. Nevertheless, movement of persons across national borders was not\nas relaxed as goods. Particularly, when the intention of crossing national border\nis to look for employment at country of destination, there are multiple\nrestrictions. As a result, labour, which is a provision of service, needs a certain\ndegree of regulation when it avails itself outside of its country of origin. With respect to trade in goods, the Global South (developing countries) exports\nmainly raw materials (primary goods) at cheap price to the markets of the Global\nNorth (developed countries), while the latter ships capital goods (finished and\nexpensive products) to the markets of the South. The international division of\nlabour with respect to trade in goods seems to have its reflection on trade in\nservices, too. From the perspective of service sector, unskilled, more often than\nnot, illegally imported and cheap labour is being exported from South to North;\nwhereas the North lawfully exports professional/skilled and expensive labour to\nthe labour markets of the South. Informally speaking, labour exported from South\nto North is assigned in the so called “3d jobs” (i.e., Dangerous, Demanding and\nDegrading) in which the nationals of the host state are unwilling to engage in. Conversely, labour exported from North into the South will be employed in\nwhite collar jobs that the nationals of the host state are not trained to engage in. 179\nSpecial Groups of Employees\nIt appears that such a reality seems to remain intact for some years to come, if not\ndecades. Generally, every country has an express or implied policy on how non-nationals\nare to avail themselves to its domestic labour market. Almost all countries accord\npriority in employment to its own nationals.",

    "text": "Presently, the Ethiopian legislature set out the conditions on the basis of which\nforeigners may be employed in Ethiopia (Article 176 Labour Proclamation and\nArticle 15 and 22(2) FCSP). Consistent with the general practice of states\nworldwide, Ethiopian law seems to give priority of employment to its nationals. However, Ethiopia has had a bilateral agreement with Djibouti to treat each other\nbased on national treatment, in the sense that nationals of both countries shall\nhave equal opportunity in the labour market of both countries. Other than this,\nit is when a particular type of service is not available in the domestic market that\na foreigner may be employed. Moreover, employment of a foreign national is\ntemporary and for a limited duration (three years) until the particular know-how\nof the foreigner is transferred to an Ethiopian national. In fact, one of the\nobligations of the foreign national would be to transfer his or her knowledge to\nan Ethiopian national. The relevant provision of the Labour Proclamation provides as follows:\nArticle 176: Employment of foreign nationals\n1) Any foreigner may only be employed in any type of work in Ethiopia\nwhere he possesses a work permit given to him by the Ministry. 182\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n2) A work permit shall be given for an employment in a specific type of work\nfor three years and shall be renewed every year; provided, however, that\nthe Ministry may vary the three years limit as required. 3) Where the Ministry ascertains that the foreigner is not required for the\nwork, the work permit may be cancelled. 4) The Ministry may, in accordance with the law, charge service fees for the\nissuance, renewal or replacement of work permit. Ethiopian nationals do not need residence permit to reside anywhere in Ethiopia; nor\ndo they need work permit to enter into the Ethiopian labour market. The Federal\nConstitution states that “every Ethiopian has the right to engage freely in economic\nactivity and to pursue a livelihood of his choice anywhere within the national\nterritory” (Article 41(1). This is not the case as regards to foreigners. For a foreigner to\nlawfully reside and be employed in Ethiopia, they need to possess double permits.

Nevertheless, in order to facilitate investment and to offer “one stop shop” service, an\naspect of the work permit issuing power has been delegated to the Investment\nCommission.

The\nduty of the employer to assign an Ethiopian substitute; and the foreigner’s duty to\ntransfer their knowledge and skill to an Ethiopian is an aspect of the commitment. Under the Civil Service employment regime, there is an express provision which\nstipulates that “a person who is not an Ethiopian national may not be eligible to be a\ncivil servant” (Article 15) because civil service is permanent employment position\nwhile foreigners can only be employed temporarily. Towards this end, Article 21\nstipulates as follows:\n183\nSpecial Groups of Employees\n2)  A government institution may appoint a foreign national on temporary\nbases, where it is proved that it is impossible to fill a vacant position that\nrequires high level professional by an Ethiopian through promotion, transfer\nor recruitment. 3) The appointment of temporary employee of an Ethiopian or a foreign\nnational, their rights and obligations as well as the condition of work\napplicable to them shall be prescribed by regulation to be issued by the\nCouncil of Ministers.

    "text": "In fact, as we indicated\nunder the introductory chapter of this text, the earliest measure of state\nintervention in employment affairs was limited to these issues. 184\nChapter V\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions (Labour \nStandards)\n5.1. General\nThe preceding chapters have provided insights into the formation and \ntermination of employment relations and it was pointed out then and there that \nemployment relation is basically a contractual relation. Nevertheless, its \ncontractual nature is not the whole truth; it is rather part of the truth. Unlike \nmost contractual engagements where almost all the terms of the contract are to \nbe determined by the contracting parties, employment relations has benchmarks \n(the so called minimum working conditions) below which the terms of the \nemployment contract may not stipulate. Thus, a contract of employment is \nexpected to “meet or exceed” such stipulations, otherwise the terms of the \ncontract, which fall below the legal threshold shall be replaced by the stipulations \nof the law. The rationale behind stipulating minimum working conditions is predominantly\nattributed to what economists call market failure. As employer and employee are\nnot on equal bargaining strength, leaving them alone to define their terms of\ncontract would not bring about an equitable outcome. Obviously the one with\nstrong bargaining power would manage to dictate its own terms. Hence, the\nstructural imbalance needs to be rectified. During the earlier periods of industrial\ndevelopment, since the market (contract) did not work well in this respect,\nmanifestations of failure such as injustice, employment insecurity and instability\nof industrial peace became problematic. Thus, freedom of contract failed in this\nregard. State intervention has been warranted in situations of market failure and\nthis seems why many governments have decided to intervene, through law, and\nregulate minimum working conditions. Most provisions of minimum labour conditions are related, but not limited, to\nprescribing minimum wage; employment security (stability); limiting\ndaily/weekly working hours; provision of paid leaves; maintenance of safe and\n185\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nhealthy working condition and compensation for employment injury. This is one\nof the areas where the social (human) dimension of employment law is to be\nobserved. At times labour jurisprudence has termed these minimum standards as\n“social provisions”. Let us identify some of them; and examine how they are\naddressed in the Ethiopian context. 5.2.

    "text": "For the purpose of the law, “wage” means “the regular payment to which a\nworker is entitled in return for the performance of the work that he performs\nunder a contract of employment” (Article 53(1). Labour history has recorded that\nleaving wage determination to the contracting parties subjected employees to\nbare minimum pay and harsh exploitation. As a result, this was one of the areas\nin which state intervention was proposed. However, it was argued that such\nintervention was unwarranted due to the fact that it would be an interference in\neconomic affairs by the state. Owing to these and other related issues there are\narguments in favour and against the introduction of statutory minimum wage in\nEthiopia. It is argued that some of the most usual propositions are the following:\nExtracted from “Introducing Statutory Minimum Wage into the Ethiopian\nPrivate Sector” by Gebre-amlak Yaebiyo Ethiopian Civil and Commercial Law\nSeries; Vol. IX (2019) footnote omitted. a) Arguments in favour of statutory minimum wage\nAlthough the institutional set up may vary from country to country, minimum\nwages exist in more than 90 percent of the ILO member states. Given the ILO\nand the international community are increasingly moving for universalization of\ncore labour standards where minimum wages can be one of those standards,\nEthiopia cannot be an exception. 186\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nFirst, Ethiopia has been extending incentive schemes to investors. Because of this,\nthe writer believes that workers’ rights should not be left for negotiation. In fact,\nfor those who cannot individually assert their rights, they can make use of\ncollective agreements and negotiations of industrial organizations or through\nstrikes. But still, this mechanism is not free of problems. Collective agreements\nusually apply on a firm basis and hence, they do not cover workers from outside. Second, though freedom of association is one of the core rights for all workers\nand opens more room for social dialogue and collective bargaining, a study shows\nthat the role and number of workers’ associations are declining over time. The\navailable workers’ associations exist primarily in public and recently privatized\nenterprises, with few in private manufacturing companies. As it is clear to\neveryone, there are massive unskilled and unutilized skilled labour forces as the\nyouth who graduated from universities, technical and vocational training centres\nare unable to get jobs. These social problems combined will deprive workers of\ntheir capacity to negotiate with the employer if wages were to be determined\nonly by individual contracts.",

    "text": "It should be noted that abundant supply of labour force means easy\nsubstitutability of labour as someone will come and fill the vacancy. Then,\nemployment contracts become “take it or leave it” options for the unskilled\nworker. A personal observation of the wages of labourers on the part of the writer\nreveals that there exists wage discrimination in the construction sector for daily\nlabourers between men and women. They earn 150 and 70 Birr, respectively for\njobs of equal value. Third, advocates of statutory minimum wage also ignited a debate into promoting\nmacroeconomic productivity by disciplining the pseudo-markets. Such markets\nare characterized as being disguised and inefficient ones which create large profit\nmargins owing to extreme exploitation. Regulated minimum wage forces these\nfirms either to raise their level of productivity (i.e. High Road Competition) or to\nexit therefrom, leaving their former share of the market to more efficient firms. Either possibility can increase productivity in formerly inefficient firms or a shift\n187\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nof production to the already more productive firms. The exponents of minimum\nwages further argue that it helps marginal workers by forcing their inefficient\nemployers either to rationalize or to be driven out of business by more efficient\ncompetitors paying higher wages. Given the aforementioned, Mizanie had to say\nthat the Ethiopian labour proclamation has an apparent weakness for its failure\nto fix the minimum wages as a minimum labour condition. In his view, in a\ncountry where urban unemployment is very high, leaving minimum wages to be\nfixed by the market does not make sense. Fourth, proponents of minimum wages argue that it has a direct impact on\npoverty reduction as long as workers in the formal economy earning minimum\nwages and their families belong to the poorest groups of the population. The point\nis, in an economy characterized by a chronic tendency to create substandard\nworking conditions, a measure designed to ensure minimum standards remains\nuseful. This argument would be equally relevant to the Ethiopian economy where\na good number of the population lives below the poverty line. In practical terms,\ninvestors might not be committed to treat and pay fair wages to employees. Despite this, the country has been time and again advertising itself as having\nindustrious and trainable labour force to improve the leverage for attracting\nforeign Direct Investment (FDI).

Fifth, the Minimum Wage Introduction Benefit Recommendation No.135\nprovides that minimum wage fixing should constitute one element in a policy\ndesigned to overcome poverty and to ensure the satisfaction of the needs of all\nworkers and their families. In that case, the fundamental purpose of minimum\nwage should be to give wage earners necessary social protection as regards\nminimum permissible levels of wages. Regrettably, empirical work shows the low\nnature of wages in Ethiopia. However, investors contend that the main reason for\n188\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nthis meagre amount of wages is attributable to the lack of efficiency and\nproductivity of Ethiopian employees. Sixth, in the light of the GTP II, Ethiopia remains committed to sustaining\ninclusive and pro-poor development strategy over the coming years to further\naddress the poverty and employment generation challenges facing the country. At the same time, it also states that greater attention will be given to attracting\nhigh quality and high impact foreign direct investment in the future. This, in\nturn, indicates the resilience of the country towards better quality investment. In\nthis regard, Mizanie seems to be interested in introducing minimum wages by\ncriticizing that the Ethiopian government is reluctant to introduce minimum\nwages for fear that such measure may scare away investors. He offered no\nalternative arguments detailing his argument, though. Unfortunately, many\nworkers see overtime work as an opportunity as it comes with additional income. The employer may reduce the normal wages of the employee to save money to\nsecure extra hours of work from the latter. Thus, the working poor would be\nsusceptible to exploitative practices. Thankfully, the Head of Ethiopia’s state-run investment body declared the\ngovernment’s desire to settle minimum wage issues among others, to protect the\ninterests of workers. Similarly, the Commissioner of the Ethiopian Investment\nCommission, while speaking to a private channel, Business Safari TV during the\nEuropean Union-Ethiopia Business Forum that took place between 14-15 May\n2019 in Brussels (Belgium) agreed with this goal.

    "text": "This labour proclamation contemplates the\nestablishment of a Wage Board which will be in charge of periodically revising\nminimum wages based on studies (Article 55(2)). Now, to be fair, let us pay a modest amount of attention to the arguments against\nthe stipulation of minimum wages as well. 189\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nb) Arguments against introduction of minimum wage\nFirst, stipulating minimum wages reduces employment opportunities for less\nskilled workers. This argument comes from the neoclassical economic theorists. According to this theory, imposing wage floor leads to job destruction and that\nmandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage would lead to an excess\nsupply of workers. In consequence, more people would be willing to work at the\nhigher rate in a limited and very selective market, but an employer could only\nemploy some people at higher wages and would likely choose the best ones. They\nargue that there is an inverse relationship between stipulating minimum wages\nand employment opportunity. The effect of minimum wage policy on\nemployment is mixed, as the results depend on employers’ compliance and\nnumerous other factors. Again most critics of neoclassical theory tend to argue\nthat even though employment losses are possible, they are by no means certain. Many economists agree that raising the minimum wage will lead to at least some\nincreased unemployment among low wage workers. Because they do not believe\nthat the imposition of a minimum wage increases productivity, opponents of the\nminimum wage foresee layoffs as employers’ only option for offsetting higher\nwage costs. They note that as an anti-poverty measure, the statutory minimum\nwages are inefficiently over-inclusive and under-inclusive. It may be argued that\nvery high minimum wages would be counterproductive if the worker cannot find\nany employment at all. In the Ethiopian public sector, the salary scale applicable to civil servants is\ndetermined from time to time by considering the Government’s financial\ncapability, the general living conditions of the society, price levels and other\nrelevant factors. The Civil Servants Law also states that all positions of equal value\nshall have an equal salary. The Federal Civil Service Agency, while revising the\nsalary scale of federal civil servants in 2015, has set a minimum wage the lowest\nlevel to Birr 860.00. In this regard, Mehari argues that before setting out a\nminimum wage for the private sector, we need to revise the public sector’s\nminimum wages as most private employers pay higher than the public service.",

The author argues that failure to do so would obliterate the\nbargaining margin of professional labourers otherwise. Second, as minimum wages no longer guarantee a “living wage,” increments are\nnecessary in order to restore a full measure of dignity to all minimum wage\nearners. Opponents respond by offering similarly uncontested evidence, the vast\nmajority of the poor do not earn the minimum wage, while the vast majority of\nminimum wage workers are not poor, they contend that lack of employment\nrather than low wages is the primary cause of poverty. As a labour market\ninstrument, a “minimum wage” has an important role to play in improving the\nliving standards of wage earners and their families; it is also an important\nindicator of economic progress and social justice. Seen from the Ethiopian\nperspective, there are no clear research findings so far, but the writer argues that\nthe realistic characterization would not have been different from the above. Third, opponents also tend to argue that low labour cost does not mean\nprofitability. Employers and their associations are mindful that cheap labour is\nnot a guarantee for competitiveness and profitability. A profit-maximizing\nemployer may choose to pay wages above market wages to incentivize good\nworkers to stay at the firm and maximize their productivity levels to yield better\nprofit margins for their employers. This is known as the efficiency wage, and it is\nalmost always above a person’s reservation wage, above the statutory minimum\nwages, and above the competitive wages. In Ethiopia, most workers are paid\ndramatically low wages for a reason mainly having to do with their inefficiency. Furthermore, the 1944 Philadelphia Declaration of the ILO enunciates that\nlabour is not a commodity. Treating labour as such would undermine its value,\nbe governed by the economic forces of demand and supply just as any other\ngeneric marketable good is. However, treating it as a non-commodity would\nnecessitate government intervention to protect labourer’s rights for the work of\na labourer ties to his dignity and is an expression of himself. 191\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nThus, one can see a valid reason to conclude that labour should be incentivized\nat various stages of production and supply chains to avoid the materialization of\nthe saying “they pretend to pay us; and we pretend to work”.",

    "text": "This would be a\nlegitimate means to avoid a disingenuous, hypocritical and patronizing treatment\nof workers by the employers. In practice, a developing body of literature also\nshows that in today’s world, companies have begun to worry about their goodwill\nas a result of which they are practically seen to have entered into several\nvoluntary undertakings in the form of corporate codes of conduct and corporate\nsocial responsibility. It must be noted that the present labour law is applicable on all employers in the\nsense that even on those who employee one employee (Article 2(1)). As the\neconomic capacity of small employers is low, not all private employers would\nhave the financial capability to hire labourers at the prescribed legal minimum. Personal communication with Mehari Redae, a prominent employment law\nscholar in Ethiopia, reveals that most of the workers in Ethiopia are affiliated\nwith individual employers. The stipulation of minimum wages without fixing the\nminimum number of workers for an enterprise to be treated as an employer could\nhave a negative impact on those small businesses. Fourth, many countries that set minimum wages extend economic assistance to\nthose who cannot find employment by using their unemployment schemes. For\nthem, minimum wages are regarded as a policy component of a welfare state. What is more, social protection coverage and benefits continue to expand, as\nreflected in the ground breaking ILO Recommendation concerning National\nFloors of Social Protection (No. 202), adopted in 2021. However, countries such\nas Ethiopia have not been able to set up such unemployment schemes so far. Today, almost all countries in the world have a social security system. There is\ngrowing evidence that labour market regulations impose employment costs\nbeyond the minimum wages. Effective enforcement requires expanding the\npowers of the responsible agencies, which includes allocating resources for labour\ninspectors to audit employers and impose penalties to enforce the minimum wage\nlaw, and in many cases, their powers are outlined in the legislation. 192\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIn some countries, the minimum wage policy affects non-wages benefits (social\ninsurance, pensions) which affect a wider group of workers and hurts overall\nworker welfare. Thus, a minimum wage increase might hurt not only low-skilled\nand low wage workers but also more highly skilled workers employed on formal\ncontracts. From this, Ethiopia may not at this point in time easily afford to bear\nthese other labour costs.",

    "text": "Besides, minimum wage increases may pass on to\nconsumer higher prices, thus resulting in higher inflation and trade-offs. This\nwould be the case in Ethiopia as there is a critical problem of market failure and\nweak end-user regulation in respect of the private sector. Finally, international evidence on the impact of minimum wages on poverty is\nmixed. It indicates that an increase in the minimum wage can help a subset of\npoor families escape poverty, but it can also push many non-poor families into\npoverty since some workers in non-poor families may lose their jobs in the wake\nof a minimum wage increase. ************************************************************\nProblem for discussion:\nHerein above, we enumerated the pros and cons for the introduction of\nstatutory minimum wage. Can you identify additional reasons, if any, in\nfavour or against each of the arguments? Which position do you think is\nmore feasible given Ethiopian reality? Regulation or deregulation? Why/\nwhy not? In 1928, the ILO adopted the Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery Convention\nNo.26, but Ethiopia is not a signatory to this instrument. Many countries have\nprescribed minimum hourly/monthly wages to employees working within their\nterritory. Others leave this issue to the contracting parties. The Ethiopian\nemployment regime seems to adopt a hybrid of the two approaches. The Ethiopian\n193\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\ncivil service regime has prescribed a minimum monthly wage for those working in the\ncivil service; while the labour law regime has left the issue to the contracting parties\nthemselves. The rational for this hybrid approach from the side of the Ethiopian government may\nbe explained by its economic philosophy. It is believed that in a free market economy,\nthe price of goods and services is to be fixed by taking into account the supply and the\ndemand side of the item in a form of bargain. This could be the main reason why the\ngovernment opted for deregulation with regard to the private sector. As regards to the\ncivil service, however, since the government is the sole employer, it can come up with\na rule binding upon itself. This can also serve as an exemplary wage for the private\nsector while negotiating on wage and other related benefits.",

    "text": "The problem associated with such an approach is the invalidity of considering labour\nas a commodity whose price is to be determined against supply and demand. The ILO\nConference under the annex for its Constitution reaffirms that “labour is not a\ncommodity” (Annex-I (a)). Furthermore, countries like the US who claim to be the\nmost faithful exponents of free market economy see nothing wrong in determining\nminimum hourly wage by law. In light of these trends and examples, the position of\nthe Ethiopian government seems to deserve reconsideration unless there are other\ncompelling policy reasons. Problem for discussion:\nAssuming that the Ethiopian government is convinced towards prescribing \nminimum wage, how should it go about it? a) Stipulating minimum wage for the lowest possible wage and leave the \nremaining to market forces or stipulating minimum wage for each \npossible job classifications? b) Stipulating minimum wage at country level or determining it by taking \ninto account the living standard of the different regions; why? c) Stipulating a minimum wage that would be applied on all sectors of the \neconomy or determining minimum wage for each sector of the economy? 194\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n5.3. Employment Security\nTraditionally, in contract of employment, both parties were to remain engaged\nso long as both of them are willing to remain engaged. If either of the parties did\nnot want to continue with the engagement, either of them was entitled to put an\nend to it. Compelling the employee to remain employed against his or her will\nwas tantamount to legalising slavery or forced labour. Likewise, it was held that\nequity would not require the imposition of unwanted service over the employer. This was the period of “employment at will.” However, such a laissez-faire approach to employment relation subjected\nemployees to employment insecurity in which they were unsure whether the\nemployment of today would continue for tomorrow. Hence, with passage of time,\nthe concept of no termination of a contract of employment without “justifying\nreason” was introduced into many national labour legislations. This minimum\nworking condition was implemented to protect the employee from arbitrary\ndismissal. It should be noted that employment, for a worker, is not only a source\nof lively-hood, but also an engagement for career development and an expression\nof human dignity.",

    "text": "The ILO has adopted “Termination of Employment Convention No.158” which\nstipulates: the employment of a worker shall not be terminated unless there is\nvalid reason for such termination connected with the capacity or conduct of the\nworker or based on the operational requirements of the undertaking,\nestablishment or service” (Art.4). Furthermore, it has been stated that the scope\nof application of the Convention is “… to all branches of economic activity and\nto all employed persons” (Art.2 (1)). The need to base termination of employment on a valid reason is the cornerstone\nof the Convention’s provisions. The adoption of this principle removes the\npossibility for the employer to unilaterally end an employment relationship of\nindeterminate duration by means of a period of notice or compensation in lieu\nthereof. It should be noted here that the question of termination of employment\nfor a valid reason is distinct from that of a worker’s right to a period of notice and\n195\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\na severance allowance. The Convention requires that there be a valid reason for\ntermination of employment, whether it is terminated following a period of notice\nor not. In other words, giving the worker a period of notice does not exempt the\nemployer from stating its reasons for terminating the employment. National laws\nand practices that only require a valid reason for termination of employment\nwhere there is no period of notice (this is generally in the case of serious\nmisconduct) and that do not require justification for termination of employment\nwhen notice has been given are not in accordance with the Convention. Ethiopia ratified this Convention in 1991 and hence it is an integral part of\nEthiopian law. Consequently, current Ethiopian laws, in compliance with the\ncountry’s ILO commitment, prohibits unjustified dismissal through different\nmodalities. The first step is laying down the lawful grounds of termination\nexhaustively and categorizing terminations outside of these grounds as unlawful\n(Articles 24-32). The second step is spelling out a procedural mechanism through\nwhich the legality of terminations would be examined by a neutral tribunal\n(Article 139). The third tool is stipulating a short probation period after the expiry\nof which presumption of indefiniteness would operate (Article 11). The fourth\nstep is prescribing a presumption in favour of a contract of employment for\nindefinite period which in effect means employment security is presumed\n(Article 9). The fifth step would be prescribing that amalgamation, division and\ntransfer of ownership of an enterprise would not have the result of terminating\nan employment contract (Article 23).",

    "text": "The sixth tool towards ensuring\nemployment security goes towards imposition of fine for undertaking unlawful\ntermination (Article 14(1)(c) cum 185(2)(c). The seventh step moves towards\nempowering a neutral organ to hold the employer liable for reinstatement or\ncompensation due to unlawful terminations (Article 43). Generally, by making\ncost of firing expensive, the law attempts to maintain employment security. It must be underlined, however, that the law does not grant employment security\nto all employees. These protections are only for those employees who are\ncompetent, productive and disciplined. A lack of competence, lack of\n196\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nproductivity, or serious misbehaviour attributable to the employee, have all been\ncategorized as lawful grounds for termination of employment. Similar grounds of termination of employment under the civil service have been\nput in place. Other than these, any termination is unlawful and the civil servant\nwould be entitled to reinstatement by the order of an administrative tribunal. 5.4. Normal Working Hours and Leaves\nBy normal working hours, we mean those periods in a day or in a week when the\nemployee regularly renders service to the benefit of his/her employer. Historically, all terms of the employment contract including determination of\nworking hour was left to the parties’ bargain. Labour history has documented that\nthere were times when an attempt to limit working hours by law was being held\nan interference of the state into private contracts. For instance, in1905, in\nLochner v. New York case, the US Supreme Court struck down a New York law\nlimiting work in bakeries to ten hours a day on the ground that it interfered with\nthe freedom of contract between employers and employees. Through passage of\ntime, however, it becomes a general practice to fix maximum hours of work by\nlaw and/or by collective agreement. In fact, limitation of maximum working\nhours became one of the most important concerns of labour laws of various\njurisdictions. In 1919, the ILO came up with a convention which embodied eight\nhours/day as the normal working hours. In Ethiopia, the Civil Code had left determination of working hours to private\nordering. A provision limiting working hours for the first time was introduced,\nin 1964, through Regulation No.302/1964. It was then stated that normal working\nhours shall be eight hours in a day and forty-eight hours in a week. Since then\nsubsequent legislations have maintained the eight hours and forty-eight hours in\na week limit.",

    "text": "Currently, regular working hours for employees under the civil service and\nlabour have slight differences. Under the civil service, it has been stipulated that\n“regular working hours of civil servants shall be determined on the basis of the\n197\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nconditions of their work and shall not exceed 39 hours a week” (Article 32). Under the Labour Proclamation, however, “normal hours of work shall not\nexceed eight hours a day or forty-eight hours a week” (Article 61 (1). In order to ensure the effective implementation of the limitation of working\nhours, the Ethiopian regulatory framework has further introduced additional\nlegislative tools. First of all, it declared that overtime work is, in principle,\nprohibited. It is only in cases where exceptional circumstances expressly stated\nby law have occurred that overtime work is allowed (Articles 66 and 67 Labour\nProclamation; Article 34 Federal Civil Servants’ Proclamation). Second, even if\nconditions for over-time work are met, the rate of payment for overtime work is\nbeing made expensive partly to discourage the employer from requiring its\nemployees for over-time work (Article 68 Labour Proclamation). Third, even if\nthe grounds for overtime work are met, there is limit of hours per day or week\nan employee can work in the form of overtime. These are four hours in a day or\ntwelve hours in a week (Article 67(2); Labour Proclamation). Fourth, an\nemployer who “causes workers to work beyond the maximum working hours set\nforth by this proclamation or contravenes in any manner the provisions relating\nto working hours is liable to fine” (Article 184(1)(a) Labour Proclamation). Moreover, the laws in both employment regimes grant a certain amount of paid\nleaves in the form of annual leave. It is believed that the purpose of annual leave\nis to enable an employee to rest without losing wages and to resume work with\nrenewed strength thereafter. When one looks at the historical development of\nannual leave in Ethiopia, it was first introduced through the Civil Code of 1960. It was then 10 consecutive days per year for a service of more than one year up\nto five years; 15 days for a service more than five and up to fifteen years; 20 days\nfor a service more than fifteen years (Article 2562). Four years later, Regulation\nNo. 302 of 1964 on minimum labour standards came up with more generous\namount of annual leave.",

( Please note that there is a difference between working days and\nconsecutive days). Both the Labour Proclamation and the Federal Civil Servants Proclamation\nwhich are currently in force have maintained the terminology of the recent\ninstrument (i.e., working days).

The\ncurrent labour proclamation, on its part, provides 16 working days as an initial\nleave for the first year of service; and one additional working day for two\nadditional years of service with no cap. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the annual leave under the civil service\nis the minimum and at the same time the maximum; while that of the labour\nproclamation is only the minimum as it can be increased through individual\ncontract of employment, work rule or collective agreement. In both cases, annual\nleave should be utilized annually since it cannot be postponed beyond two budget\nyears (Ethiopian Insurance Corporation v.

The civil service regime\nappears to be more generous in this regard. It grants eight months sick leave out of\nwhich the six months are fully paid; the next two months are with half pay.

At the time, it was not all public holidays, which\nwere paid. An employee who was on the service of an employer for at least two months\nwas entitled to six paid holidays out of the fourteen public holidays in a year. The six\nholidays in question were to be agreed between the employer and the employee\nindividually; or where such existed through a collective agreement (Article 6).

Safe and Healthy Working Conditions\nIt is well known that industrial activities are full of risks. Risks could be either to\nlife, health, property, the environment, or to surrounding communities   Risk\nmay express itself in the form of accident, occupational disease or environmental\npollution. More often than not, employees are the most vulnerable group of\nsociety to these risks. Traditionally, whenever an employee sustained an employment injury, it was left\nto the individual worker. Some of the justifications for such an approach were\nthat the wage which was being paid by the employer included payment for\npossible risks; and the principle of “voluntary assumption of risk” in which the\nemployee assumes the risk of being harmed when they decided to work on that\ncircumstance. Both of these rationales served towards justifying “let the damage\nrest where it falls” and hence the employee was essentially held as his own\ninsurer. In connection with this idea, a certain American writer stated the following. “Early common law duties of master to provide safe workplace became effectively\neviscerated by the mid-nineteenth century by three common law defences\navailable to employers. The three legal doctrines, contributory negligence,\nvoluntary assumption of risk, and fellow servant rule, formed the “unholy trinity”\n201\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nof employer common law defences. First, workers whose own negligence had\ncontributed to their injuries were barred from recovery under the contributory\nnegligence rule. Second, a worker was deemed to have assumed the risk of\naccidents by accepting employment. By accepting employment without specific\nreservation of protection against accidents, workers were deemed to have\nbargained away their rights to hold the employer responsible for risks known to\nthem or normally incident to that kind of employment.",

Based\non this, the assumption goes, by accepting employment, the worker could be\ndeemed to have assumed the risk of negligence of his fellow servants. As a last\nresort, the injured worker’s only remedy was to bring an action against co-\nworkers, who most likely were unable to pay or wholly judgment-proof. Thus, the nineteenth century common law rules left the burden of injuries on\nthe working people who suffered them, regardless of whether they had the ability\nto avoid the accident, change the degree of danger, or even object the dangerous\ncondition. The general employer’s duty to provide a safe workplace came to be\nweakened by three ever more broadly interpreted exceptions and by the legal\nfiction that the working person was deemed to have assumed the risk of his or\nher bargaining for the job.” With the passage of time, however, this position gave way to the principle of\ntransfer (passing off) of risk. Many jurisdictions adopted a presumption of\nemployer’s liability for employment injury cases. The reason for such a paradigm\nshift has been more of economic rationale and equity. In economic terms, when\nan employer is held liable to cover the costs of employment injury, it will transfer\nsuch cost into society by thinly distributing this expenditure in the price of the\nproduct or services, which the employer made available to the market. Hence an\nemployer is in a better position than the employee to spread the cost to the\nconsumers. Furthermore, as the employee sustained injury while at the disposal\n202\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nand service of the employer, it is economically justified and equitable if it is held\nliable. If the employer benefits from the service of the employee, then the\nemployer should compensate the employee when injury occurs. Finally, under\nthe “deeper pocket” principle, the employer is in an economically better position\nto cover such cost even if it fails to transfer it off to consumers. The Ethiopian legal system has had also expressly incorporated the principle of\nemployers’ liability ever since the promulgation of the Civil Code in 1960\n(Articles 2548-2559). In fact, prior to the Civil Code, Factories Proclamation of\n1944 (Proclamation No. 58/1944) had few provisions pertaining to safety\nmeasures in factories.",

    "text": "The limitations of the Factories Proclamation have been\nelaborated under Chapter-1 above. Be that as it may, employer’s liability since\nthe coming into force of the Civil Code has two levels, namely at the level of\nprevention, and at the remedial level. 5.5.1. Preventive measures\nGenerally, it is considered that preventive measures are cheaper, easier and better\nthan curative efforts because even with maximum expense and expertise some\ninjuries may not be able to be reinstated to a pre-damage situation. At the level\nof prevention, the law requires the employer to take the necessary measures to\nprevent preventable risks. Accordingly, the Civil Code stipulates that “the\nemployer shall take such measures as are required by the special circumstances\nof the work to safeguard the life, physical integrity, health and moral standing of\nthe employee” (Article 2548). Labour Standards Proclamation No.232/1966 legislated similar prescriptions that\nneed to be complied by employers (Article 10). Particularly, employers are\nobligated “to arrange the buildings and premises wherein employment is carried\non in accordance with all legal arrangements relating thereto and provide therein\nall safety, welfare and health protection measures and devices required to be\nmaintained or normally found in similar enterprises” (Article 10(1). 203\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nComing to the currently operative regulatory framework, an employer is\nobligated to take the necessary measure to safe guard adequately the health and\nsafety of workers; take appropriate steps to ensure that workers are properly\ninstructed and notified concerning hazards of their respective occupation; and\nassign safety officer, and establish an occupational health and safety committee\n(Article 92(1) and (2). Moreover, an employer is required to provide safety\nequipment and provide training about how to make use of the equipment (Article\n92(3). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the employee has also a corresponding duty\nat the level of prevention. They are expected to make use of the protective tools\nappropriately and at appropriate time and place (Article 93 (4). Furthermore, they\nare obligated to obey all health and safety instructions (Article 93(5). Hence,\nprevention of employment injury demands conscious involvement of both parties\nin the sense that it requires bilateral care (i.e. two sides precaution). The way the law is formulated in allocating responsibility between the parties\nappears to be fair. Those preventive measures that require money have been\nentrusted to the employer, while the measure which demands behavioural\nadjustment has been imposed on the employee.",

    "text": "However, it must be admitted\nthat preventive measure may not be successful at all times. Even with utmost\ncare, it is possible that a risk may be materialized; and as a result employment\ninjury may occur. Thus regulating prevention, though necessary is not sufficient\nin this regard. With this view in mind, the law comes out with provisions\nnecessary in regulating the remedial stage as well. 5.5.2. Remedial measures\nBy remedial stage what we mean is, entertaining compensatory measures after\nthe damage has already occurred. This stage, in actual effect, is pin pointing the\nmodalities for loss distribution. Once an industrial accident or occupational\ndisease is sustained, who should cover the loss or how this loss be distributed; and\namong whom should it be distributed, are all policy considerations. 204\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIn this regard, three possible solutions could be proposed:\na) let the damage rest where it falls in a sense that the employee should incur the loss\nherself;\nb) let the damage be passed-off to the other party in this case to the employer; and\nc) in principle, let the damage be passed-off to the other party, but in few cases, the\ndamage should rest where it falls. Ethiopian law seems to adopt the third option in sense that employer’s liability is\nthe prevailing standard (Article 96(1) but when victim’s intentional fault is\nshown, the damage will rest where it falls, and thereby the employer is\nexonerated from liability (Article 96(2). Accordingly, as a consequence of its\nliability, the employer is expected to cover the cost of medical treatment and\nmedication including the cost for any necessary prosthetic or orthopaedic\nappliances. Hence, the employer’s liability is not limited to the stage of\nprevention. It rather covers costs associated with the remedial stage also so long\nas the injury is related to the employment. The nature of the employer’s liability may be either contractual or extra-\ncontractual. On the one hand, if the injured employee does not want to rely on\nthe fault of the employer, they may base their claims on the provisions of the\nLabour Proclamation before the labour division of the regular court provided that\nthe injury is an “employment injury”. On the other hand, if they can show\nemployer’s fault and employment injury, they may bring an action before a civil\ncourt on the basis of the relevant extra-contractual provisions.",

It is worth recalling that the alternative\nremedial tracks have been available ever since the Civil Code era (Article 2559). In the world of practice, however, employees who sustained employment injuries\nhave been inclined to rely on the contractual liability track. 205\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nProblem for discussion:\nPlease discuss the pros and cons of bringing an action based on contract of\nemployment and under the Labour Proclamation or extra-contractual\nliability in order to seek compensation in employment injury cases. At this level, it may be pertinent to consider as to how employer’s fault can be\nestablished in such cases. Article 12 of the Labour Proclamation lists out\nobligations of the employer. Specifically, Article 12(5) prescribes that “an\nemployer shall take all the necessary occupational safety and health measures and\nto abide by the standards and directives to be given by the appropriate authorities\nin respect of these measures.” This means failure to comply with such mandatory\nprovisions would amount to fault by virtue of Article 2035 of the Civil Code;\nbecause pursuant to Article 2035(1) “a person commits fault where he infringes\nany specific and explicit provision of a law or administrative regulation”. Although employer’s liability regardless of fault on its part, it must be noted that\nan employer is not a 24 hours insurer of an employee. Its liability is limited to\ninjuries associated with employment. This will take us towards identifying when\nan injury is deemed to have been related to employment and is thereby\nconsidered as “employment injury.” Extracted from “Simplified Guide to Ethiopian labour law” (By Mehari Redae:\nILO-2007)\nEmployment injuries could be categorized into two kinds. They are either\noccupational accidents or occupational diseases (Article 95(1) Labour\nProclamation).",

    "text": "206\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nPursuant to Article 97(1) “occupational accident” is any organic injury or\nfunctional disorder sustained by an employee:\n­ while carrying out the employer’s order during time and place of work; or even\naway for the work place or outside his normal hours of work ;( e.g., one below)\n­ while at the place of work before or after his work or during tea or lunch breaks\n;( e.g., two below)\n­ while the employee is proceeding to or from place of work in a transport service\nprovided by the employer (e.g., three below). Elucidating them by way of example may be helpful. Herein below are some\nhypothetical cases. E.g., one\nBekele’s right arm was seriously injured while he was operating a machine at his\nplace of work. E.g., two\nSosna sustained injury when fire broke out at a cafeteria within the compound of\nher workplace during a tea break while she was drinking tea. Although she was\nnot performing work at the time of the injury, she was there for the purpose of\nthe work and hence her injury is categorized as an occupational accident. E.g., three\nSeyoum was going to his place of work when the car he was in collided with a\ntrain. He thereby sustained serious bodily injury. The vehicle he was in was a bus\nassigned by his employer to transport employees to and from place of work. Another workmate of Seyoum, Shifa, similarly sustained injury on his way to\nwork place using a taxi. Shifa hired the taxi by money he received from his\nemployer in the form of transport allowance. 207\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nSeyoum’s injury is an employment injury while Shifa’s is not. The reason for so\nholding is Seyoum was going to work through a means of transport chosen and\nassigned by the employer and hence the employer is responsible for the\nconsequences of its choice. But Shifa was proceeding to work through a means of\ntransport chosen by himself. Thus he was going to work at his own risk and hence\nno employer liability. Occupational disease, for its part, is any pathological condition whether caused\nby physical, chemical or biological agents which arises as a consequence of:\n­ the type of work performed by the employee or\n­ the surroundings in which the employee is obliged to work. Nevertheless, occupational disease does not include endemic or epidemic disease\nwhich is prevalent in the area where the work is done.",

    "text": "Such disease will only be\nconsidered an occupational disease for those employees who are exclusively\nengaged in combating such diseases by reason of their occupation. E.g., four\nOsman was a store keeper at a cotton plantation in Afar Region for five years. While at work, he contracted malaria and died due to it. His family instituted a\ncourt action against the cotton plantation for compensation claiming that their\nbreadwinner died due to occupational disease. The claim of the deceased’s family is untenable under the law. Malaria in Afar\nregion is an epidemic disease and hence contracting malaria in Afar is a “generally\navailable risk” to the inhabitants of the locality whether employed or not. Thus,\nit cannot be considered as occupational disease. Another example, Seid is a health officer in the same cotton plantation. His job\nresponsibility was looking after the well-being and health of the employees\nincluding malaria prevention. While on duty, he contracted malaria. 208\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIn this example, malaria is an occupational disease for Seid because he is exposed\nto “increased risk” of malaria contraction more than others due to his job\nresponsibilities. Hence, he should be protected from such risk if he is to\neffectively render service without hesitation under the contract. 5.5.3. Exemption from liability\nAs indicated earlier, an employer’s liability is limited to employment injury cases. Employment injuries as indicated above are predominantly injuries sustained at\nthe place and time of work; and injuries somehow related to the work. Thus, the\nemployer is not an all time (i.e. twenty-four hours) insurer of the employee, as\nregular working hours are only eight hours per day. Even for injuries sustained\nat the time and place of employment, there are exceptional situations where the\nemployer can validly avoid liability. However, these are exceptions and rules of\nlegal interpretation dictate us that exceptions are to be interpreted narrowly. A case in point is “an intentional infliction of harm by the employee exonerates\nan employer from liability” (Article 96(2). Negligent infliction of harm upon\noneself by the employee would not immune the employer from liability under\nthis heading. Fault of a third party would not serve as a defence as well (Mandefro\nEshetie v. Fredirch Evert Stiftung; File No.36194: Vol.8). In fact, even under the\nCivil Code era victim’s (worker’s) intentional fault was a valid defence against\nemployer’s liability (Article 2553).",

    "text": "Nevertheless, the employer would have the\nburden of proof to show that the employee had indeed intentionally inflicted\nharm upon oneself. However, there is a need to determine as to when an employee be considered to\nhave intentionally inflicted harm upon herself. Admittedly, it is difficult to\nconfidently determine one’s intention as it is a state of mind. Nevertheless, it is\nwell established that intention could be inferred from externally manifested acts\nof the author. With a view to limiting controversy in litigation, the Labour\nProclamation (the Civil Code has similarly formulated provision) has laid down\npresumptions in which intentional infliction of harm could be inferred. 209\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\nAccordingly, any injury resulting from the following acts shall be deemed to be\nintentionally caused by the worker (Article 96(2)(a and b):\n- non-observance of express safety instructions given by the employer or the\nprovisions of accident prevention rules; or\n- reporting to work in a state of intoxication caused by taking alcoholic beverages\nor drug that prevents him from properly regulating his body or understanding. It has been stated earlier that one of the statutory obligations of an employee is\nto report for duty in fit physical and mental condition (Articles 13 (4) and\n14(2)(d)). Moreover, refusal to observe safety and accident prevention rules and\nto take the necessary safety precautions is a prohibited act for an employee\n(Article 14(2)(f)). Thus when an employee commits either of them, she or he, in\neffect, is violating one of his or her primary obligations. This seems the reason\nwhy such an employee is denied employment injury benefits in such situations. The employer will be exempted from liability and the damage will rest where it\nfalls (Article 96). Indeed, justice demands that one should not benefit from one’s\nintentional fault. In Mitiku Hailu v. Mesfin Tilahun; File No. 67201: Vol. 13 case, the employee\nreported for duty in state of intoxication. His immediate supervisor instructed\nhim to leave the premises. But the employee resumed working ignoring the\nsupervisor’s instruction. He sustained injury while in the state of intoxication at\nthe workplace. The employee brought an action against the employer with a view\nto collecting compensation for employment injury.

Some of the reasons offered for such a holding\nwere:\n­ what is provided in the labour law is minimum entitlement to the\nemployee, and medication abroad could by no means be a minimum\nbenefit; and\n­ as the labour law is a domestic legal instrument, it should be interpreted to\npertain to facilities that are domestically available. Interestingly, the relevant provisions both in the Civil Code and the Labour\nProclamation have been similarly formulated. But the two cases showed that the\nImperial Supreme Court and the Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division\nrendered entirely opposite decisions. Which position do you think is in line with\nthe legislative intent? Why? 5.5.5. Disability Benefits\nThe employer’s liability is not limited to medical costs. It will further be obligated\nto provide disability benefits to the employee. As body organs do not have market\nvalue, disability is to be assessed in light of the reduction in working capacity due\nto the injury. Experts in the medical field are important to make this\ndetermination. In a sense this is a medico-legal issue. The amount of the disability\nbenefit is dependent upon the degree and duration of disability. Ordinarily, disability may be temporary or permanent. It may also be total or\npartial; the worst-case scenario, of course, is death. E.g. (1)\nAmare sustained a severe car accident while delivering goods for the company\nand he was prevented from rendering his employment service for six months due\n214\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nto the accident. Such disability is temporary because the employee was\ntemporarily from providing service. E.g. (2)\nPetros lost his right arm due to an accident associated with his employment. This\nkind of injury is partial and permanent. It is partial disability because, by losing\nan arm, the employee is not to lose 100% of his working capacity because of the\nsaid injury. Nevertheless, it is permanent injury because it will remain with him\nthroughout his lifetime. The law has regulated these different scenarios differently. For the purpose of the\nLabour Proclamation, temporary disability is a reduction in working capacity that\nmay last for a maximum duration of twelve months starting from the date of the\noccurrence of the injury (Article 107(1)(a) and 108).",

In cases where the injury resulted in permanent disability, the employer will be\nobligated to provide lump sum compensation to the injured. The maximum\npayment available for an employee who suffers total permanent disability due to\nemployment injury is a sum equal to five times of the employee’s annual wage\n215\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\n(Article 109(3)(a)). The employer’s liability, therefore, is both limited and\nliquidated. If the injury sustained resulted in permanent and total disability, the\nabove-mentioned payment shall be calculated in proportion to the degree of the\ndisability accordingly. For instance, if an employee who was earning Birr 6000/month sustained total\nand permanent disability, due to employment injury, his disability benefit will\nbe:\n6000 (monthly wage) * 12(yearly wage) * 5(years) = Birr 360,000\nHowever, if the employee who lost his/her right arm was verified by a medical\nboard to have lost 30% of his working capacity, and was earning Birr 6000/month\nprior to the accident; his/her disability benefit will be:\n6000*12*5*30/100 (degree of disability) = Birr 120,000\nAt this juncture, it is important to note that the verification of the medical board\nis not conclusive and binding on the courts. Courts have the power and flexibility\nto customize the medical board’s verification with the detailed facts of the case\nbefore them.",

    "text": "For instance, in Dereje Wuletaw v. Walia Leather Processing (File\nNo.49273: Vol.9) case, the employee lost three fingers each from his hands due\nto employment injury. The Medical Board verified that the victim has been\ndisabled 65%. The Cassation Division however reasoned that the verification of\nthe medical board does not take into account the reduction in working capacity;\nit merely assesses the level of disability sustained by the victim due to the\nemployment injury to a human being in general. The Cassation Division thus\nruled that the loss of six fingers results in 100% reduction in working capacity\nand thereby awarded five years wage of the employee. However, reduction in\nworking capacity is not to be assessed in light of capacity to work the pre-injury\ntasks but other gainful tasks as well (Agricultural Products Promotion and Supply\nEnterprise v. Getachew Gedlie; File No.43370: Vol.8). 216\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAs indicated in the case of temporary disability benefit, the permanent disability\nbenefit is also exempted from tax. In another note, it is important to underline\nthat an employee will not be entitled to permanent disability benefit if they have\nalready a pension scheme or an insurance scheme arranged in advance by the\nemployer. For instance, in public enterprises or the civil service sector, if an employee\nsuffered permanent injury of serious nature, they will automatically be pensioned\nand thereby benefit from the government pension scheme. In such cases the\nemployee will not be entitled to employment injury compensation as she cannot\nbenefit from two sources for a single injury. The same principle applies where\nthe employer arranged an insurance scheme for the benefit of the employee\nprovided that the payment based on the insurance policy is not below the amount\nprescribed by law. However, if the payment based on the insurance policy is\nbelow this amount the difference shall be covered by the employer because the\namount prescribed by the law is the minimum amount (Mihret Alene v.\nEthiopian Tourist Enterprise; File No.97512:Vol.16). Unlike the Labour Proclamation where the maximum ceiling of liability is\ncapped, employer’s liability for permanent employment injury cases under the\nCivil Code was not a predetermined and liquidated amount. The employer had\nthe duty to supply maintenance to the employee and their family unless the\nvictim had other family members to maintain them. For how long, how much\nand other related issues were to be determined by the court. The relevant\nprovision reads as follows:\nArticle 2558 - 3.",

    "text": "Obligation of maintenance\n1) Where the employee is permanently deprived by the reason of the accident or\nthe disease, of half or more than half of his capacity to work, the employer\nshall maintain the employee and his children who are under age. 2) Such obligation shall not bind the employer unless the employee cannot\nobtain maintenance from members of his family. 217\nLegally Stipulated Minimum Working Conditions\n3) It shall be governed by the provisions of the Book of this Code relating to\n“Family Relationship” (Art.807-825). Finally, if an employee dies due to employment injury, the employer will be obliged\nto pay “dependent’s benefit” to the dependents of the deceased. The amount of such\npayment will be the employee’s five years wage to be paid in the form of lump sum. Furthermore, the employer will cover the funeral expenses for the deceased employee\nas well. In order to avoid controversy the law has formulated forced definition as to\nwho the deceased’s “dependents” are:\nDependents are nominated by the law itself and hence “nominated beneficiaries” these\nare:\n­ the employee’s widow/widower;\n­ children of the deceased who are under the age of eighteen;\n­ any parent of the deceased who was being supported by the same. As per the above explanation, it is not all dependents of the deceased who will be\nentitled to the dependents’ benefit. It is only the close relatives, nominated\nbeneficiaries, of the deceased who will be the beneficiaries. It appears that the\nwidow/widower’s benefit is automatic because unlike the other two, the law did not\nattach any condition and it is available by virtue of being a widow or widower. However, the Cassation Division in Dr. Mandefro Eshete v. Fredrich Evert Stiftung;\nFile No.36194:Vol.8 case, a widower and his minor daughter brought an action against\nan employer for fatal accident sustained by his wife and the child’s mother. It was\ndetermined that the widower had his own means of living at the time. The Cassation\nDivision held that since the widower has his own means of subsistence, he is not\nentitled to dependent’s benefit; it is only the deceased’s daughter who is entitled to\ndependent’s benefit. It seems debatable as to whether the spirit of the law is as\ninterpreted by the Cassation Division or not. What do you think?",

Kifleyohannes\nTessema et al; File No.72645: Vol.13\nTo recapitulate our deliberations on this part, it elaborated issues associated with the\nindividual employment relations. The various chapters under this part focused mainly\non the individual employee as to his or her rights and duties during employment and\nupon separation. The next part will be devoted towards examining the relevant\nregulatory frameworks pertaining to collective aspects of industrial relations. Under\nthis part, employees in their collectivity will be the focus of our discussion. Issues of\nunionization and collective bargaining will be examined in Ethiopia and\ninternationally as well.

General\nFreedom of association is the right to come together with others to collectively\nexpress, promote, pursue and/or defend common interests. In the context of\nemployment relations, freedom of association manifests itself in the form of the\nright to unionization and the right to form employers’ associations. By making it\npossible to establish organizations of workers and employers and by providing\nthem with the means to further and defend the interests of their members,\nfreedom of association is a factor in the achievement of social justice and one of\nthe principal elements in the achievement of lasting peace. In fact, collective employment relations are unthinkable without ensuring the\nright to freedom of association because it is through associating with one another\nthat individuals become a collective body. Association brings about organized\nand collective voice. However, there were times in labour history when such\nrights were not given recognition. It was through passage of time that the right\nhas been given due recognition. Similar historical trends, as we shall see later,\nhave been observed in Ethiopian labour history. History of freedom of association in Ethiopia dates back to the 1963 Labour\nProclamation. Proclamation No.210/1963 stated that:\na) Employers may create and join employers’ associations and employees\nmay establish and join labour unions. Said organizations, when registered\nby the Minister, may engage in all lawful activities. b) No employer or employee may belong to more than one employers’\nassociation or labour union, respectively, at the same time.",

    "text": "222\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nc) No labour union may be created in an enterprise employing less than fifty\npersons; provided, however, that employees of such enterprises may join\ngeneral labour unions. d) The Minister may, in exceptional circumstances, waive the provisions of\nparagraph (b) and (c) of this Article 20. Even though the introduction of the law on freedom of association was\nconsidered a step in the positive direction, the stipulation that “no labour union\nmay be created in an enterprise employment less than fifty persons had limited\nits applicability as enterprises employing fifty and above were very few by then. ILO jurisprudence considers that the establishment of a trade union may be\nconsiderably hindered, or even rendered impossible, when legislation fixes the\nminimum number of members of a trade union at obviously too high a figure, as\nin the case, for example, where legislation requires that a union must have at least\nfifty founding members. It was with the coming into force of Labour Proclamation No.64/1975 that the\nminimum number of membership was reduced to twenty. ILO writings are of the\nview that the legal requirement that there be a minimum number of twenty\nmembers to form a union does not seem excessive and, therefore, does not in\nitself constitute an obstacle to the formation of a trade union. Subsequent\nlegislation maintained this acceptable threshold and to some extent further\nreduced the minimum membership requirement. Currently, the minimum\nmembership requirement is ten. Currently, the right to freedom of association is no longer a right emanating only\nfrom an ordinary legislation. It is rather a constitutionally recognized right. The\nrelevant provisions are reproduced hereunder. Article 31: Freedom of Association\nEvery person has the right to freedom of association for any cause or purpose. Organizations formed in violation of appropriate laws, or to illegally subvert the\nconstitutional order, or which promote such activities are prohibited. 223\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nArticle 42: Rights of Labour\n1. ( a) Factory and service workers, farmers, farm labourers, other rural\nworkers and government employees whose work compatibility allows for\nit and who are below a certain level of responsibility, have the right to\nform associations to improve their conditions of employment and\neconomic well-being.

(c) Government employees who enjoy the rights provided under\nparagraph (a) and (b) of this sub-Article shall be determined by law. The right to freedom of association has both positive and negative features. In its\npositive aspect, the right encompasses, the right to form an association or join an\nalready established association. Conversely, the negative freedom of association\nis manifested through the right not to join any association or to withdraw from\nmembership of an association at any time. In terms of scope, based on the ILO\nConvention No.87, freedom of association should be guaranteed “without any\ndistinction whatsoever” in the sense that it should be available without\ndiscrimination of any kind based on occupation. Thus it is available not only to\nworkers in the private sector of the economy, but also to civil servants and public\nservice employees in general. Since, Ethiopia is a signatory to the Convention, its Constitution has followed a\nsimilar pattern in stating that freedom of association is available to factory and\nfarm workers on the one hand; and to employees of the private sector and civil\nservants as well. However, with respect to civil servants, the Constitution does\nnot seem to accord freedom of association to all civil servants. The right is rather\nlimited to civil servants “…whose work compatibility allows for it [for\nassociating] and who are below a certain level of responsibility”. In order to\ndetermine those “whose job position allows for association” and at “what level of\n224\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nresponsibility” is allowed for association, the Constitution promised that a law\nwould be issued. But the promised law has not yet gone into effect though more\nthan twenty five years have elapsed since the Constitution was promulgated in\n1995. Pursuant to ILO Convention No.87, all public service employees (with the sole\npossible exception of the armed forces and the police, as indicated in Article 9 of\nthe Convention No. 87), should, like workers in the private sector, be able to\nestablish organizations of their own choosing to further and defend the interests\nof their members.",

In view of the importance of the right of employees of the State and local\nauthorities to constitute and register trade unions, the prohibition of the right of\nassociation for workers in the service of the State is incompatible with the\ngenerally accepted principles that workers, without distinction whatsoever,\nshould have right to establish organizations of their own choosing without\nprevious authorization. From this perspective, since, as stated earlier, Ethiopia is\na signatory to ILO Convention No.87, it is high time that the Ethiopian legislature\nshould come up with a law that would enable civil servants to associate if it is to\ncomply with its ILO obligations. Paradoxically, however, in National Bank of Ethiopia Employees Trade Union v.\nMOLSA; File No.55731: Vol.11) we had the following facts: Employees of\nNational Bank had a duly registered and certified trade union for almost thirty\nyears. In 2008, the National Bank was re-established by Regulation No.157/2001\non the basis of which its employees are to be regulated by a special law. As soon\nas MOLSA learnt that the Bank’s employees are excluded from the ambit of the\nlabour law, it brought an action before the Federal High Court for the\ncancellation of the registration of the trade union. The High Court ruled that the\ngrounds of cancellation under Article 120 of Proc. No.377/2003 (Article 121 in\n225\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nProclamation No.1156/2019) do not include change of regulatory regime as\nground for cancellation. Hence, it denied the application. The Ministry lodged an appeal against the decision of the High Court. The\nFederal Supreme Court appellate division held that since employees of the Bank\nare excluded from the applicability of the Labour Proclamation pursuant to\nArticle 3(2)(e) of same, the application for de-registration is appropriate; and\nhence the registration of the trade union should be cancelled. The trade union petitioned for cassation proceedings contending that the\nappellate court committed fundamental error of law by ignoring the Article 31 of\nthe FDRE Constitution and ILO convention No.87 and 98 to which Ethiopia is a\nparty as they allow formation of association available to all employees without\ndistinction whatsoever. Nevertheless, the Cassation Division upheld the appellate\ncourt’s ruling on the reasoning that employees who are entitled to form\nassociation by virtue of the Labour Proclamation should satisfy the definition of\nemployees under that particular law.",

Therefore,\nthe mind-set at the executive level and judiciary seem restrictive in the sense that\nleave alone to allow unionization of civil servants in the near future, those civil\nservants who were formerly unionized have been subjected to dissolution. Be that as it may, in order to give effect to the provisions of the Convention and\nthe Constitution and to create an enabling environment towards unionization,\nthe Labour Proclamation has articulated provisions here and there under its\noperative part. Herein below are some of the most pertinent ones. Article 14(1)(d): It shall be unlawful for an employer to coerce any worker by\nforce or in any other manner to join or not to join or cease to be a member of a\ntrade union or to vote for or against any given candidate in elections for trade\nunion offices. 226\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nArticle 26(2): The following shall not be deemed to constitute legitimate grounds\nfor the termination of a contract of employment;\n(a) his [the worker’s] membership in a trade union or his participation in its\nlawful activities;\n(b) his seeking or holding office as a workers’ representative;\nArticle 43(1):\nWhere a contract of employment is terminated because of those grounds\nmentioned under sub-Article (2) of Article 26 [above], the employer shall be\nobliged to reinstate the worker, provided, that the worker shall have the right to\npayment of compensation if he wishes to leave his employment. In order to encourage employees form or join trade unions, one of the first and\nmost important steps is to offer legal protection against anti-union discrimination\nbecause history of trade unions documented that, more often than not, employers\ntended to cultivate hostile attitude against union organizes and union members. Towards this end, there is a need to provide assurance that no person shall be\nprejudiced in his/her employment by reason of their trade union membership or\nlegitimate trade union activities, whether past or present. It must be underlined\nthat protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should cover not only\nhiring and dismissal, but also any discriminatory measures during employment,\nin particular transfers, downgrading and other acts that are prejudicial to the\nworker.",

The preparation of\nmodel constitutions and rules for the guidance of trade unions, provided that\n229\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nthere is no compulsion or pressure on the unions to accept them in practice, does\nnot necessarily involve any interference with the right of organizations to draw\nup their constitutions and rules in full freedom.” Consequently, Article 118 has\nlisted out elements which should be included in the constitution of a trade union. Exercise:\nPlease prepare a model constitution (by-laws); one for a trade union; and\nanother for employers association. Article 119: Registration of Associations\n1) Every association shall be registered by the Ministry or the appropriate\nauthority in accordance with this proclamation.",

However, by virtue of Labour Proclamation No.42/1993, the Ministry had the\npower to suspend or dissolve associations (Article 120). It was for the association\nconcerned to lodge an appeal to the competent court in order to nullify the\nadministrative measure. This position of the law was being criticized for its\ninconsistency with Ethiopia’s commitment to ILO instruments because Article 4\nof Convention No.87 to which Ethiopia is a party prescribes that associations may\nnot be suspended or dissolved by administrative body. This has been rectified\nsince the coming into force of Labour Proclamation No.377/2003. The total sum up these all provisions of the Labour Proclamation tend to indicate\nthe following:\n­ The minimum number of membership to establish trade unions has been\nfixed so low at ten members (Article 114(2) that it enables employees in\nsmall enterprises to associate. Besides, relaxed registration procedure in the\nsense that the registering organ shall respond within 15 working days; and\nno response within the prescribed period amounts to acceptance of\nregistration (Article 119 (2) is another favourable environment for\nassociations. Exempting original trade union registration from payment of\nstamp duty (Article 119(5) is helpful as well. ­ The fact that associations could not be dissolved by an executive organ\nsafeguards them from arbitrary interferences of administrative organs in\nthe associations’ day to day activities.

    "text": "This policy is\nconsidered to be a paradigm shift towards the ILO desired direction, away\nfrom the previous policy of “mono-union” system. Problem for discussion:\nConcerns have been raised from different corners that allowing more\nthan one trade union in an enterprise would create a fragmented labour\nforce which would adversely affect unity and solidarity. Based on this\nconcern, trade union leaders are sceptical that laws which allow plural\nunions are against the interest of the labour force. On the other hand, others contend that legislative prescription which\nstipulates only one union can be established in an enterprise is an\ninterference on freedom of association. The argument goes; it should be\nleft to the members how to associate and how many unions to form. What is your view on this topic? 233\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\n6.2. The legal framework for employment related Freedom of\nAssociation in Ethiopia: A historical perspective\n6.2.1. Introduction\nExtracted from “Privatization in Ethiopia: Its impact on Unionization and\nCollective Bargaining” PhD thesis by Mehari Redae (University of Warwick-\nUK-2015)-footnotes omitted. The preceding chapters assessed issues associated with individual employment\nlaw in Ethiopia. This chapter, for its part, will focus on the legal framework for\nfreedom of association in general and trade unionism in Ethiopia in particular. The challenges and opportunities trade unionism have had under the three\nsuccessive Ethiopian regimes (the Imperial, the Derg and the post-Derg regimes)\nwill be assessed. The first two sub-topics of the chapter will generally narrate the\ndevelopment of the right to freedom of association and its transformation to the\nstatus of one among the “core” labour rights. Besides, its mode of operation in the\nera of the globalized economic order shall be dealt with as well. This will provide\nan analytical framework for understanding the fundamental nature of the rights. The failure of “freedom of contract” to bring about fair outcomes in industrial\nrelations principally is owing to the structural imbalance in the bargaining power\nof the parties; and it demanded some sort of remedial measure to redress the\ninequality. Employees tried to mitigate the effect of the power imbalance by\norganising themselves in trade unions, thereby seeking to negotiate as a collective\norgan instead of individually. However, at earlier times in labour history,\nformation of associations by employees was treated as “cartel”, and thereby\nincompatible with the then prevailing free market philosophy due to its alleged\nmarket distortion effect on the supply and price of labour.",

    "text": "Trade unionism was also, at times, considered to be tantamount to conspiring\nagainst the economic and property rights and interests of the employer, and\nhence a prohibited act. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Combination\n234\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAct of 1799, took a prohibitive stand towards combinations of workers. Germany\nalso had a law with equivalent effect until it was repealed in 1869. In order to\nbypass these prohibitions, workers at those times were compelled to associate\nthemselves in non-industrial societies, such as social clubs, friendly societies and\nself-help groups. It was with passage of time that formation of associations was generally tolerated\nand permitted. Even when allowed, employers at the stage of recruitment or\nthereafter would require their employees to commit contractually either not to\njoin or if already a member, to withdraw from union membership as a condition\nto employment or the continuity thereof. The so called ‘yellow dog’ contracts of\nthe time were geared towards this purpose and they had been given legal effect\nas binding contractual terms. Intimidation and dismissal of union organisers and\nunionists was also widely practiced. Resistance either by employers and/or\ngovernments to workers’ associations emanated from the perceived danger to\neconomic and political stability respectively. Hence, uneasiness towards\nemployees’ combinations may emanate from employers or governments or both. The history of labour movements has recorded these challenges overtime. In the context of Africa, the history of trade unionism has been impacted by the\nvaried traditions and histories of their colonial powers and the continent’s\nheterogeneous nature in terms of people and cultures. According to Schillinger\n“the setting up of African trade unions took place with the blessing and open\nsupport of the colonial administration which saw in it a means of keeping social\npeace”. Similarly, Kaufman documented that “as long as these unions did not\nbecome overtly militant and hotbeds for nationalist independence, the British\ntolerated them and even saw value in their activities”. However, in French-\ncontrolled Africa, a relatively repressive stance towards the indigenous labour\nmovement and trade unions prevailed. Hence, the pattern of development for\ntrade unionism in Africa had diverse historical backgrounds. 235\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\n6.2.2.

    "text": "Indeed, no matter\nhow rudimentary it may have been, human beings even in traditional societies\nhad a collective dimension to life in order to collectively counteract more\npowerful natural or man-made challenges. According to Dunning, Pope Leo XIII\nunderlined, in 1891, which “the State should not prohibit employers’ and\nworkers’ organizations, because it was the natural right of men to come together\nin this way”. From an industrial relations perspective, an employees’ association\nis a source of strength for defending common interests through an organised voice\non issues of common concern against comparatively more powerful employers;\nand from a human right perspective, it is an expression of human freedom. Although developments in freedom of association may have features peculiar to\nspecific countries, a degree of commonality is provided to freedom of association\nat the international level by human rights instruments of both global and regional\ncoverage. Among the instruments of global application are: the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (1948), the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966), and the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) (1966). Article 20 (1) of the\nUDHR provides that “everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and\nassociation” while sub-Article (2) of the same Article provides that “no one may\nbe compelled to belong to an association.” Article 22 of the ICCPR, for its part,\nprovides: “everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others,\nincluding the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his\ninterests.” The ICESCR also has a provision on “the right of everyone to form and\njoin the trade unions of his/her own choice.” Although the UDHR technically is\na non-binding instrument, the latter two instruments were adopted through the\ntreaty making process of the UN General Assembly, and theoretically their scope\nof application is global with respect to states that ratified them. 236\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nAs regards instruments of regional scope, the right to freedom of association has\nbeen incorporated under various human rights instruments such as the European\nConvention on Human Rights (1950), The American Convention on Human\nRights (1969) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981).",

    "text": "The\ninternational human rights instruments have been drawn up under a broad\nframework in a manner that enables every human person to have the right to\nassociate. This formulation covers all possible combinations of an economic,\nsocial and political nature, ranging from the formation of political parties and\nconsumers’ associations to associations of hobby clubs. There are also more specific and specialized instruments relevant to workplaces. These are the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise\nConvention No.87 (1948); and the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining\nConvention No.98 (1949). Both of these were adopted under the auspices of the\nInternational Labour Organisation and hence applicable within the sphere of the\nILO’s mandate. The right to freedom of association, in this context, is available\nboth to employers and employees. Indeed, the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, the\nsource document for the establishment of the ILO, underlined that “the right of\nassociation for all lawful purposes” by the employed as well as by the employers\nwas held to be among “the principles of special and urgent importance.” The Philadelphia Declaration of 1944, which has been incorporated into the ILO\nConstitution, reaffirmed the Organisation’s commitment to four most important\nprinciples among which “freedom of association” is one. In addition to these\nprinciples, membership of the ILO has been made conditional upon formal\nacceptance of the Constitution including the Declaration of Philadelphia, the\nright to freedom of association being enshrined in both instruments. However,\nsince the Constitution and the Declaration were stated in very broad terms, it was\nwith the coming into force of Conventions No.87 and 98 that freedom of\nassociation was translated into specific enforceable rights and obligations\navailable to workers as well as employers. 237\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nIt is important to underline, however, that though the right to freedom of\nassociation is available both to employees and employers, in real terms; it was\nemployees who demanded and most in need of associations.

It can after all be argued by way of\njustification that “the individual employer is already a collective power in being\na holder of capital.” Records of the Committee on Freedom of Association\nconfirmed that almost all of the complaints before it that are associated with\nimpediments to freedom of association have been brought by trade unions.",

    "text": "In fact, the framers of the various international instruments seemed to be\nconscious of the needs-based approach, when they formulated a specific\nprovision on the right to form and join trade unions addressed solely to workers. This was in addition to the general provision on freedom of association, which\nenables both employer and employee to associate. This should not, however, lead\nus to the conclusion that freedom of association is irrelevant to the employer\naltogether. Rather, in the face of organised labour, a single employer may\nrelatively prove to be weak and hence the need also for employers’ to associate. Moreover, an employers’ association may also help them deal with host\ngovernments with a view to lobby for business-friendly policies and laws. In the African context, trade unionism had distinct political as well as economic\ndimensions. It was very much associated with the introduction of\nindustrialization, and industrialization was closely related with colonisation. Except for small scale indigenous handicraft activities, industrialization and\nindustrial relations were brought with colonial powers into Africa. Industrial\nrelations during colonialism expressed itself, among other things, in\ndiscriminatory treatment in general, and discrimination between foreigners and\nthe indigenous labour force in particular. A struggle against this discriminatory\ntreatment appeared to be one among the many objectives of trade unionism in\nAfrica. Unionization was also instrumental in expressing the organised voice of\nlabour against exploitation by capital and, in some cases; it was instrumental in\nthe struggle against colonialism. It, thus, had social, economic and political\n238\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nobjectives as a result of which significant overlap between the various goals was\nbeing observed in union activities. Hence, unionization, in colonial Africa, had\nmultiple objectives and responsibilities to accomplish. 6.2.3. Production and regulatory challenges to Trade Unionism\nThe current global economic order and social interactions have brought their\nown unique features on the manner of production and marketing of goods and\nservices. With the advent of globalisation, production processes have undergone\nprofound transformation in terms of location and organisation. The underpinning\nrationale is that in order to obtain maximum benefit out of comparative\nadvantage variables, the part of the production process requiring intensive labour\nwill be undertaken in territories where cheap, compliant and appropriately\nskilled labour exists; and the remaining part of the production would be processed\nin an area where the required input is cheaper. One consequence of such a\ndecentralized production process has been the emergence of labour market\nflexibility.",

    "text": "To benefit from labour market flexibility, the use of home workers, casual or part-\ntime employees, rather than permanent ones; the outsourcing and subcontracting\nof aspects of the production process rather than performing it in-house have\nbecome the norm of workplace arrangement and management. As a result, the\nworkforce profile has significantly changed from permanent and full-time\nemployment to more of temporary engagement. New forms of work may be contrasted to the period of the steam engine and later\nduring the industrial revolution where thousands of employees worked in\nassembly lines in close proximity to each other, in full time arrangements and\nunder a single and common employer, the current production brought a\nparadigm shift. Rather the current economic order has introduced a decentralized\nproduction process, thereby bringing in multiple employers and multiple\nlocations into the production scene. The conventional in-house and assembly line\nproduction system, sometimes referred to as the “Fordism” model, for car\n239\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nmanufacturer Henry Ford, has been transformed into extra-territorial production\nchains where a single product crosses multiple national borders while undergoing\nits completion process. This decentralisation of the production process has been\nmade possible due to, among other things, cheap and smooth transportation,\ntogether with quick and user-friendly information and communication\ntechnology which are manifestations of the global economic order. Such transnational production systems and labour arrangements have made the\nformation of trade unions in their traditional combination and composition less\nfeasible. At times it has been argued that “laws on unionization have remained\nmainly local, while the production process has become transnational.” Moreover,\nin the developed world, with the fast development of the service sector, the\nlabour force profile has changed from predominantly manual to more of a “white\ncollar” work or knowledge work. White collar labour appears to be less interested in unionization than the manual\nlabour. Even from the perspective of the developing countries, Fashoyin recorded\na substantial increase of temporary and fixed term employees and informalisation\nin Kenya since the 1990s. According to him this labour force profile has adversely\naffected union membership density as these workers have been uninterested or\nless interested in unionization. Furthermore, globalisation has provided favourable conditions for the easier\nmovement of capital across borders. Legal assurances for the international\nmovement of capital that have been secured through bilateral, regional and\nmultilateral agreements have made movement of capital easier than ever before.",

    "text": "Conversely, relative to capital, labour, particularly unskilled and semi-skilled\nlabour, is less mobile and at times immobile altogether. Owing to its mobility and\nthreat of mobility, capital has gained strong bargaining leverage in its relation\nwith host governments and trade unions. As a consequence, countries have\nentered into competition among each other in attracting and retaining\ninvestment through the provision of facilitative policy and legal frameworks. 240\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nFrom the investment point of view, ensuring political stability and infrastructure\nfacilities available, though still necessary, has no longer been sufficient to attract\nand retain investment. In addition to these considerations, tax incentives, lax\nenvironmental regulations and low labour standards have become additional\noffers of incentive from some investment destinations particularly from the\ndeveloping world. Compa in his general report documented that “many countries\nhave adopted labour law reforms that reduce labour standards”. Moreover, there\nhave been attempts to attract capital through the establishment of de jure or de\nfacto ‘union free’ workplaces. For instance, in some developing countries, measures have been taken for the\nestablishment of Export Processing Zones (EPZs) where protective labour laws\nwere withdrawn from application. In some situations, though the protective\nlabour law may not be expressly repealed for fear of political backlash, their\nenforcement would be deliberately avoided or delayed. One of the protective\nlaws that may be at risk in such circumstances has been the right to unionization\nas there is a perception that organised labour is much more demanding than\nwould be the case with a non-unionised workforce. Unlike the pro-active\nattitude of many states in labour affairs at the early and mid-twentieth century,\nthe era of globalisation brings about ‘business-friendly’ states, which hesitate and,\nat times, seemed incapable of intervening in labour relations. As a result, an\nimplied policy to postpone enforcement and to stay the execution of labour rights\nuntil such time economic growth is attained has developed. However, the position of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association is\nexplicit in this regard and states that “where governments of host countries offer\nspecial incentives to attract investment, these incentives should not include any\nlimitation of workers’ freedom of association (…).” It is, thus, in contravention of\nsuch an express ILO position that countries enter into a “race to the bottom”\ncompetition to attract capital at the expense of labour rights.",

    "text": "In this regard, there are theoretical and empirical arguments that contend lower\nlabour standards do not necessarily attract investment. It is believed that\n241\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nmotivation, productivity and innovation could be obtained only when employees\nare granted freedom of action and humane treatment. The argument is that lower\nlabour standards would bring about de-motivated and at times ill-motivated\nlabour to the detriment of industrial peace, productivity and investment. However, it is contended that higher labour standards do not necessarily imply\nlower profitability. Empirical studies also show that the general flow of\ninvestment is towards the high labour standard jurisdictions. It is even argued\nthat “in most cases, jurisdictions with higher labour standards have been\nsuccessful in impressing investors.” Generally, it seems that investors are more interested in the availability of factors\nsuch as, political and macroeconomic stability; conducive infrastructure facilities\nand independent and expeditious dispute resolution together with skilled and\ndisciplined labour rather than low labour standards. Under this view, the decision\nwhere to locate an investment is mainly dictated by considerations other than\nlabour standards. Moreover, it was argued that economic liberalisation will have\nan effect of upgrading labour standards as transnational companies have had the\ntendency of bringing in “management technique more respectful of workers and\noften pay higher wages than the local firms”. While the establishment of ‘union free’ workplaces approach tends to consider\nlabour standards as the decisive factor in determining investment locations, the\ncountervailing argument that labour standards do not have an impact on\ninvestment decisions fails to appreciate that labour standards constitute one\namong the many factors that will be taken into account in selecting investment\ndestinations. In particular, when the investment under consideration is a labour\nintensive one, consideration of labour costs would not be taken lightly as it\nimpacts cost of production-thereby competitiveness. Of course, factors such as infrastructure, political stability, and the existence of\nindependent dispute resolution machinery are important factors to be considered\nin determining investment locations. However, when the competing\njurisdictions are more or less similar in respect of these factors, the issue of labour\n242\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nstandards may be factored in the decision making. It is important to note that “a\nmarginal increase in labour costs due to higher labour standards will put a nation\nat a competitive disadvantage in relation to its competitors”.",

    "text": "An illustration of this labour cost factor can be found in a plant level study\nconducted in 2003 on a decision by Nike, one of the major sportswear companies,\nto relocate its operations. The study found that Nike had plans to relocate to\nVietnam some of its factories situated in Indonesia, apparently on grounds of\nbetter political stability in the former. However, the actual reason for the\nrelocation was the wage level which was much lower at the new destination. Similarly, in the United States where the other factors relevant for investment\nsuch as infrastructure, market access, political stability, and an independent\njudiciary have been evenly distributed among the federated states, studies have\nshown that “(…) those states with high rates of unionization and high wage rates\nhave had significantly lower rates of manufacturing growth over a long period of\ntime”. In general, regardless of the diversified views in this regard, in the current\neconomic order, the overall trend towards unionization, union density and the\nrole of unions have been on the decline. These are mainly the outcome of the\nchanges in production and regulatory regimes dictated by the global economic\norder and fierce global competition. The situation of trade union in Africa is more or less similar with what has been\nnarrated above in the sense that similar cost sensitive relocation measure from\nNigeria was reported. Moreover, Kosor and Hayter recently described the\nAfrican situation in the following manner:\n(…) privatization began reducing the employment in state enterprises\nwhich has been hitherto the bastion of unionism across Africa. Export\nprocessing zones where associational rights are constrained began to emerge\nin crucial locations, and the number of hostile private employers [towards\n243\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nunionization] began to increase [as a result] trade unions lost substantial part\nof their constituency and potential members. With this broad framework on the subject of trade unionism in mind, in the\nsubsequent sections, an assessment will be made on the development of\nunionization in Ethiopia in historical perspective to understand where and how\nit emerged and where it now stands so that future challenges and opportunities\ncould be anticipated. 6.2.4. Early labour combinations in Ethiopia\nThere has been evidence that awareness towards modern industrial relations\npractices first came during the early to mid-20th century when Ethiopian workers\nhad the opportunity to work with or under the supervision of French and Italian\nnationals. Some Ethiopian Franco-Ethiopian railway company employees had\nworking visits to France through which field observation on employment\nrelations was gained.",

    "text": "This mixture of labour profile was more visible with the\ninflux of many Italians as workers and supervisors during the Italian occupation\nof Ethiopia in the Second World War. The opportunity to work alongside\nEuropeans enabled the Ethiopian employees to acquire experience as to how\nemployment relations operated elsewhere where industrial relations were well-\nentrenched. Working in close proximity with foreign workers, though advantageous in terms\nof acquiring experience, was however associated with discriminatory treatment\nin general and discriminatory payment in particular. Foreign workers were\nrelatively favourably treated compared to their Ethiopian counterparts even in\ncomparable job positions. Thus, though all employees had common grievances\nagainst their employers, Ethiopian employees had additional grounds for\ndiscontent. Nevertheless, there were common concerns to all workers such as\nissues of job security, safe and healthy working environment, excessive working\nhours and the absence of paid leaves. 244\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nThere was, for instance, an incident resulting in discontent of all workers which\nwas associated with sick leave of an employee. This incident occurred, in 1951,\nat the “Ethio-fibre factory” which employed 200 workers at the time. A female employee of the factory fell sick and was absent from work. Her close relatives communicated her sickness to the employer in due\ntime. However, the employer was suspicious as to the accuracy of the\ninformation and demanded that the employee should somehow appear\nbefore it. She was transported to the premises of the factory on a\nstretcher. Unfortunately, she died while on the shoulders of the people\ncarrying her back home, after verifying to the satisfaction of the\nemployer that she was indeed seriously ill. Immediately after that incident, a wild-cat strike broke out within the workers’\ncommunity in general and at the premises of Ethio-fibre factory in particular. Indeed, prior to this incident, there had been another similar strike, in Dire\nDawa, at the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company where around 1500 workers\nconsisting of French, Italian, Greek, Djiboutian and Ethiopian nationals\ndemanded, among other things, wage increments, limitation of daily working\nhours and decent working conditions. The incident suggested that employees’\ndifferences in nationality or other variables did not necessarily pose any\nimpediment to waging a united struggle towards a common purpose. Moreover,\nthe fact that these incidents ignited such wide-ranging anger indicated that there\nwas a deep rooted and cumulative but hidden sense of discontent in the\nworkforce waiting for an opportune moment.",

    "text": "However, there was no room for unionization until 1963. In the absence of a legal\nframework for association, there were times when workers had to march to the\nPalace to present petitions directly to the Emperor. Nevertheless, with the\nnumerical increase of the labour force and the increase in volume and complexity\nof the discontent, the opportunity for personal appearance before the Emperor\nwas not readily available whenever the workers wanted it. 245\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nThe absence of any legal basis did not, however, completely inhibit attempts to\norganise. The Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company employees, for instance,\nformed an association, named ‘Syndicate des Cheminots Ethiopien’ and managed\nto obtain de facto recognition by their employer in 1947. By representing its\nmembers, the association gained concessions from the employer in narrowing the\nwage differential between Ethiopian and expatriate employees and in limiting\nthe employer’s arbitrary measure of dismissal. Inspired by the successes of the\nemployees of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company, many employees in\nvarious enterprises organized themselves in establishing groups and friendship\nsocieties among co-workers, locally known as Idir (self-help association) and\nmeredaja (mutual assistance) in their respective premises. However, these\nassociations did not have direct dealings with the employers. They, nevertheless,\nhelped in mitigating the employees’ economic hardships created by employers’\nunilateral and arbitrary measures such as dismissals, uncompensated employment\ninjuries, old age and illnesses. Thus, at the early stages of labour movements in Ethiopia, as the formation of\ntrade unions was not permitted by law, employees were inclined to associate\nthemselves in the form of mutual assistance and cooperative societies. This\nhistorical trend seemed to resemble the early labour combinations in other\njurisdictions where “friendly societies” of employees were the way towards\nhelping each other among the co-workers in times of need. 6.2.5. Constitutional recognition of freedom of association in Ethiopia\nWith the promulgation of the 1955 Revised Constitution of Ethiopia, freedom of\nassociation was for the first time officially and constitutionally recognized in the\ncountry. The then Emperor, Haileselassie I, handed down the Constitution to his\n‘subjects’ with the following introductory remark in the preamble: “We,\nHaileselassie I, (…) hereby proclaim and place into force and effect as from today\nthe Revised Constitution of the Empire of Ethiopia, for the benefit, welfare and\nprogress of Our beloved people”.",

    "text": "246\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nThe Revised Constitution devoted a full chapter to the “Rights and Duties of the\nPeople”. Among the rights relevant to labour relations which were enshrined in\nthe Constitution were ‘freedom of speech’ (Art.41), the right to ‘peaceful\nassembly’ (Art.45) and ‘the right to form or join associations’ (Art.47). However,\nall of those provisions were accompanied by a limiting phrase such as ‘in\naccordance with the law’ or ‘within the limits of the law.’ The phrase “in\naccordance with the law” or “within the limits of the law” pre-supposed the need\nfor the issuance of legislation for the proper implementation of the constitutional\nprovisions. Thus, in order to make freedom of association meaningful, the\nRevised Constitution should have been followed by legislation with detailed rules\nfor implementation. But, until the adoption of the Labour Relations Proclamation\nof 1963 (eight years later) no implementing legislation was put in place pertaining\nto the formation of industrial associations. Due to this, Bahru was of the view\nthat ‘the human rights provisions, such as freedom of speech and of assembly,\nwere inserted [in the Revised Constitution] largely for public relation exercises\nmeant mainly to appease international partners rather than a genuine\ncommitment at respecting and implementing the specified rights’. Meanwhile, workers were inclined to conduct clandestine meetings as to how\nthey should best deal with their employers. For instance in 1961, leaders from\nself-help workers’ organisations representing eleven companies met secretly in\nAddis Ababa to discuss a ‘united front’ to deal with their respective employers\nand the government. Following this, a series of wild-cat strikes and\ndemonstrations were held at the premises and against the companies. The most\nserious of the strikes was one called by the Franco-Ethiopian Railroad Company\nworkers which lasted more than a month. Frequent wild-cat strikes not only\nadversely affected the production and service provision thereby industrial peace\nbut also began to harm social and political stability. Although the country’s employed workforce at the time was estimated to be no\nmore than 50,000, the geographic concentration of the labour force was within\nand adjacent to the Addis Ababa-Dire Dawa railway route which was then an\n‘industrial corridor’.",

    "text": "Hence, ‘the small number of the labour force was\n247\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\ncompensated by its concentration’ in close proximity to the political centre of the\ncountry. This provided the labour force with the leverage to pressure the\ngovernment to address these concerns and the government was ‘unable to resist\nthe pressure from labour any longer’. Therefore, the need to prevent or at least\nto regulate strikes came to the forefront so that production process could be\nunhampered; and social and political stability maintained. Hence, at around the\nfirst half of the 1960s, instead of trade union suppression, legalising their\nexistence and regulating their activities was considered appropriate policy\nresponse thereby leading towards the adoption of Labour Proclamation in 1963. 6.2.6. Formal establishment of industrial associations in Ethiopia\nThe 1960s in Ethiopian history was a period when ‘modernity’ along the lines of\nWestern values through legal reform was attempted to be introduced. Until this\ntime, despite its longstanding ILO membership, Ethiopia appeared to have\ndragged its feet in laying down the necessary legal framework for the formation\nof industrial associations. It was in 1963 (after 40 years of ILO membership) that\nit adopted a law (Proc. No.210/1963) to regulate the formation of industrial\nassociations and their mode of operation. Incidentally, it is also worth noting that\nthe two important ILO conventions on freedom of association (Conventions\nNo.87 and 98) were ratified by Ethiopia in 1963. The decision to adopt the Labour Relations Proclamation, it can be argued, might\nhave been dictated by a combination of domestic, regional and international\nsituations. Domestically, it had been seen that demands for respect to\nunionization were usually accompanied by wild-cat strikes, which not only\naffected the production process but also brought social unrest. Moreover, while\nthe labour force was displaying such a sense of discontent against the\ncontemporary legal and social order, an attempted military coup, in December,\n1960, had promised, among other things, job creation and respect for\nfundamental and democratic rights. It appeared that by raising economic and\nsocial issues pertinent to the labour force, the coup organisers were looking for\nthe support of the Ethiopian labour force in their effort to overthrow the then\n248\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nEmperor. Even though the coup failed, the government seemed to have felt the\nneed to respond positively to the labour forces’ longstanding demand for\nunionization with a view to pre-empting future social and political unrest.",

    "text": "There was also a regional factor to be considered here. With some African\ncountries gaining independence since the second half of the 1950s, preparation\nfor the establishment of an ‘Organization of African Unity’ (OAU) was under way\nin the early 1960s. Addis Ababa was selected to host the first meeting of the\nAfrican Heads of State in May, 1963. By then most of the newly independent\nAfrican states had vibrant trade union movements symbolising an organised\nvoice against both exploitation and colonisation. The fact that Ethiopia was not\nphysically colonised by any colonial force was believed to be one of the main\nreasons for selecting Addis Ababa to host the Summit. Given this impression, it\nwould have been ironic if Ethiopia, the ‘symbol of independence’, were devoid\nof legally recognized trade unions. On this issue, Ananaba stated that ‘policy\nmakers in Addis Ababa thought that it would be most embarrassing if it were\nknown, particularly by the more militant African leaders, that Ethiopia was the\nonly independent country which had no legal trade union movement (…)’. Beyond the regional considerations, at the international level, the ILO was\ninfluential. Formal participation at the ILO Conferences requires Member States\nto comprise their respective core delegation with four members: two government\nrepresentatives, one employers’ association representative and another trade\nunion representative. As a result, formation of associations was a precondition for\nfully-fledged attendance at the ILO Conferences. The ratification of Conventions\nNo. 87 and 98 had also required an implementing instrument to give them effect\ndomestically. An additional influence at that time was a by-product of the ‘Cold War.’ The\nInternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) representing the\n‘Western bloc’ labour movements was actively involved in African labour\nmovements with a view to broadening its ideological sphere of influence. Similarly, the World Federation of Trade Union (WFTU) representing the\n249\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\n‘Eastern bloc’ labour movement was engaged in a functionally equivalent effort. Both were putting pressure on African governments to introduce labour friendly\nlaws and policies. In general, it is argued that the second half of the twentieth\ncentury has been designated as the “age of rights.” All these internal and external\nfactual circumstances seemed to have pressed the then Ethiopian Emperor to\nurgently issue a ‘Decree’ without even waiting for the parliament to reconvene\nfrom its recess.",

    "text": "The consequence was that as soon as the Labour Relations Proclamation (1963)\nentered into force, 109 trade unions consisting of 60,000-70,000 workers were\nformed and registered with an appropriate agency within less than a year. The\nsignificantly high number of trade unions being formed within a short period\nindicated that workers were eager for unionization. In April 1963, within months\nof the promulgation of the Proclamation, the CELU was established, as an\numbrella labour organisation at the national level. This development was\nmirrored on the employers’ side by the creation of an organisation named the\n“Ethiopian Employers’ Federation”. The formation of associations for both\nemployees and employers enabled an Ethiopian tripartite delegation to attend an\nILO General Conference for the first time, the 47th annual General Conference in\nJune 1963. Although its adoption was considered a success for workers, the Proclamation\nappeared to have an explicit objective of restricting the labour force from general\npolitical activities. In this regard, the law had an express provision prohibiting\nassociations from engaging in any political activity whatsoever (Article 22(c)). The then Secretary General of CELU, Beyene, documented the challenge of the\ntime in the following manner:\n(….) we [the trade union leaders] continued organizing workers in\nenterprises; however, the political atmosphere was very tense and\nmembers of the National Security and the Palace were hindering the\nprogress of our undertakings. Some of our members would be arrested\nwhile others were physically intimidated. 250\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIt is debatable whether the Ethiopian labour movements at the time had political\ninclinations since their major concerns were ‘bread and butter’ issues. Unlike\ntrade unions in many parts of the African continent whose activities were\ncombined against, and at times overlapped with the struggle against colonialism,\nthis was not the case in Ethiopia since it was never physically colonised. Nevertheless, it is believed that the express exclusion of industrial associations\nfrom political activities was geared towards ‘disciplining’ workers in their\nrelation with the government by requiring them to be apolitical. Moreover, in order to avoid frequent strikes, the Proclamation spelt out a long\nlist of what amounts to ‘unfair labour practices’ for the parties which included\ninitiating industrial action ‘prior to submission of the labour dispute to the Labour\nRelations Board and before the expiration of a period of sixty days following such\nsubmission.’",

    "text": "Thus, the law, while granting the right to unionization also had an\nimplicit objective of minimizing the frequency of strikes to the maximum extent\npossible. In this regard, the following highly critical reaction to the labour law by a union\nleader is very revealing and worth quoting at length:\nYour union has tied our hands and feet. Before you allow us to organize,\nwe used to get substantial concessions from employers by merely\nthreatening to walk out. The employers know that we do not kid when\nwe threaten-the work [walk-out], even the equipment was not safe. Yet\nnow you have advised us that through the union we have first to discuss\nwith our employers, then if we are not satisfied, we have to submit our\ngrievances to the Labour Relations Section of the Ministry and if we are\nnot reconciled by the Section, we have to lodge our dispute with the\n‘Labour Relations Board’. The case does not stop there; either employers\nor employees can appeal to the Supreme Imperial Court on the decision\nof the Board (…). We neither have the money, the time nor the\nmanpower to follow up our disputes through these channels. Your\nunion [law] has only tied us to the benefit of our employers. 251\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nOn the other hand, the employers’ side was of the view that the coming into force\nof the law which legalised unionization was not necessary to the country’s then\nprevailing stage of industrial development. An employer in a major enterprise\nhad, then, spelt out his objection to the labour law in the following manner. Trade unionism to developing Ethiopia is a luxury. You merely follow\nthe system and practices of developed countries like England and\nFrance and are crippling our budding economy. You are discouraging\nforeign investment [by issuing such a law] (…).’ Although the representativeness of the above-mentioned views may be\ndebatable, in general terms, union activists seemed to consider the law as\nrestrictive to union activities while employers were of the view that it was a\npremature and untimely instrument to then existing infant industrial\ndevelopment. Regardless of these divergent views, however, the coming into\nforce of the ‘Labour Relations Proclamation’ paved the way for the development\nof labour law as a distinct branch of law outside of the Civil Code in terms of\nstructure and content. Its distinct nature may be inferred from the contents of\nthe proclamation among which the following points are particularly noteworthy.",

    "text": "First, the labour law incorporated detailed rules for the formation of employer\nand employee associations and spelling out their rights and obligations. Second,\nthe registration of these associations was entrusted to a distinct ministry (the\nMinistry of National Community Development and Social Affairs) a different\nministry from the Ministry of Internal Affairs which was empowered to register\nand monitor all other not-for-profit associations in the country. Third, detailed\nrules on collective bargaining and collective agreements were put in place. Fourth, the Law provided for the establishment of a ‘Labour Relations Board’, a\ntripartite labour dispute settlement forum outside the ordinary courts. As regards the substantive power of the Ministry, it had no mandate to provide\nprior authorization for the formation of associations; its power was limited\nmerely to the registration of associations. Even with registration, ‘if the Ministry\n252\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nfailed to take any action with respect to the application for registration within\nthirty days, the association was deemed to have been registered.’ Thus, any delay\nin taking action on an application for registration amounted to an acceptance of\nregistration which provided a relaxed procedure for the formation of associations. Furthermore, the Ministry, being an administrative organ, was not empowered\nto dissolve associations. Its power was limited to petitioning the regular courts to\ndeclare dissolution which is consistent with the ILO prescription in this regard\n(Convention No.87, Art.4). Apparently these were suitable measures towards union formation. Nevertheless,\nthe labour law fixed a threshold of fifty employees in an enterprise to form a first-\nlevel trade union. Given the low level of industrial development in the country\nat the time, this threshold was considered high since there were very few\nenterprises that employed that size of a workforce. Thus, it was argued that\nthough the adoption of the labour law providing for union formation was\nconsidered a positive step, the high threshold of membership placed a substantial\nrestriction on the exercise of the right. Subsequent labour legislations, as will be\nseen later, have progressively reduced the minimum membership requirement to\nform a trade union. The Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO Governing Body, in\nprinciple, has not been against laws prescribing minimum level of membership\nto form a trade union. It, however, has been of the view that ‘union formation\nshould not be considerably hindered or even rendered impossible by fixing too\nhigh a figure’.",

    "text": "Indeed, the Committee had expressly stated that ‘a law that\nrequired a threshold of fifty employees was too high’. Therefore, the law was\ninconsistent with Ethiopia’s international obligation under the ILO in this\nrespect. 6.2.7. Industrial associations under the Military Rule\nIt was mentioned earlier that the military government claimed to have followed\na socialist-oriented path of development. Through this ideological lens, it was\n253\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nviewed that private capital was exploitative and a class enemy while labour was\nconsidered a source of wealth and development. With this ideological mind-set,\nthe Labour Proclamation of 1963 that was designed to treat employers and\nemployees on equal footing in the formation of associations was incompatible\nwith this ideological orientation. Thus it came up with another pro-labour\nemployment law (Proc. No.64/1975) that entitled employees to form trade unions\nwithout providing equal opportunity to the employers. The ILO Committee of\nExperts criticized and reminded Ethiopian authorities that their measure, in this\nregard, was in contradiction to Ethiopia’s obligation under the ILO Convention\nNo. 87. However, this law remained in force until the demise of the military rule. Moreover, the labour law of the military rule reduced the minimum number of\nmembership to form a trade union at the enterprise level to twenty employees, a\nfigure less than half of the threshold of the preceding law. Indeed, workers were\nbeing encouraged to become members of trade unions as they were considered\nessential partners to the fulfilment of the centrally planned and command\neconomy which was an important feature of the economy. As a result,\nencouraged by the new political setting, around 290,000 employees were\norganised under various industrial unions within a short period of time. Unlike the time of the Emperor, where some employers were hostile towards\ntrade unionists and union organisers, there was no fear of retaliation during the\nmilitary regime as long as unions were not acting against the political system. Although privately owned major means of production and distribution were\nnationalised, in some cases, the old management group remained in office to\nadminister those enterprises as replacing the technocrats within short period of\ntime was not practicable. Thus, trade unions were considered as ‘vigilante groups’\nentrusted with the role ‘to check possible economic sabotages by the management\ngroup that was considered ideologically hostile to the new socialist political\nsystem’.",

Besides, transfer of a trade union leader from one place of work\nto another was not lawful without the consent of the employee concerned or the\nprior approval of the Minister.

In this state of affairs and on the perception that the then prevailing ideology was\nfavourable towards trade unionism, trade unions were extensively organised and,\nas of 1985, there were 174 basic trade unions made up of around 300,000 members\nacross the country. Moreover, there was no law empowering the Ministry to\nsuspend or dissolve associations except that it was authorised to refuse\nregistration of an association on legally enumerated grounds in which case the\nassociation had the right to appeal to a court of law. There was, however, a trade-off against such a ‘union-friendly’ environment. The\nthen labour proclamation prescribed that it was only a single trade union that\ncould be lawfully established at an enterprise level, thereby expressly declaring\nthe “mono-union” policy. It was also politically affiliated with the ruling party. At times, there existed an overlapping of responsibilities in the sense that trade\nunion leaders were at the same time influential figures in the political party\nstructure. For instance, in 1980s, the then President of the All Ethiopian Trade\nUnion was, at the same time, a Central Committee member of the Workers’ Party\nof Ethiopia (the only lawful and ruling party). The affiliation between the Party\nand the trade union was so intimate that the line of demarcation was so blurred. Interestingly, as indicated above, the Imperial regime had put legislative\nmeasures in place and employed surveillance activities to restrict trade unions\nfrom engaging in political activities. Conversely, the military government\n255\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nintroduced a paradigm shift by encouraging trade unions to step into the political\narena.",

    "text": "The politicisation of trade unions was not, however, a blank cheque given\nto the unions in that they were not at liberty to make affiliation with any political\nparty of their own choosing. On the contrary, trade union leaderships who were\nnot politically allied with the military regime were subjected to ill treatment. An additional constraint was that the law made basic trade unions subordinate to\nhigher ones. Article 50(7), for instance provided that ‘lower level trade unions\nshall be obliged to accept and implement the decisions of the higher trade\nunions’. Finally, the law provided for the establishment of an ‘All Ethiopia Trade\nUnion’ as a single umbrella trade union at the national level instead of leaving\nsuch issues to be decided internally by the unions themselves. As a result, first-\nlevel trade unions were in effect treated as branch offices to the higher levels. A further restrictive dimension relates to international affiliations. Article 51(2)\nof the labour law limited the establishment of international affiliation so that it\ncould be undertaken only by the national association at the top without offering\nsuch an opportunity to first-level or mid-level trade unions. Nevertheless, the\nrelevant ILO conventions allow associations at all levels to freely establish\ninternational affiliations. It is, therefore, arguable that the apparently favourable\nlegal framework towards unionization during the military government had a\ntrade-off in terms of loss of autonomy and independence of the trade unions. As indicated previously, private employers were denied the right to associate\nunder the military rule. As the government was the major employer even in the\neconomic sphere due to the nationalisation of the major means of production and\ndistribution, it can be said that there were few private employers, as such, to be\norganised. But there were small and numerous enterprises such as garages, bars\nand bakeries still under private ownership co-existing with the state ownership\nsystem. In consequence, the denial to employers of the right of establishing\nassociations was a decision more of ideological than practical considerations. Moreover, the command economy and the lack of managerial autonomy did not\nenable the state owned enterprises to run their businesses in an economically\n256\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nrational way. Due to this, most state owned enterprises, at the time, were loss\nmaking-thereby regularly being subsidized from the state treasury.",

Thus the\nfeasible way appears to be to strike a reasonable balance between providing\nsufficient economic space for private sector development on the one hand; and\nensuring the promotion and protection of fundamental labour rights on the other. However, Owing to denial of the right of association during the military rule,\nprivate employers were highly marginalized not only economically due to\nnationalisation of property but also organisationally. Thus, it may be argued that\nneither the employers nor the employees benefited from such an arrangement. Regardless of the outcome, however, the era of trade union regulation of the\nImperial rule was transformed to an over-regulated trade unionism during the\nmilitary regime in terms of autonomy, independence and political orientation of\nthe trade unions. 6.2.8. Industrial associations during the post-Derg period\nWith the collapse of the military regime in 1991, a change in ideological\norientation and a new economic policy were introduced. The socialist path of\ndevelopment gave way to a capitalist path of development while the command\neconomy was replaced by market-led political economy. The international\nclimate since the early 1980s was one of economic liberalisation mainly\nmanifested through privatization accompanied by, among other things, market\nand price deregulation. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the dismemberment of the\n‘communist bloc’, in Central and Eastern Europe were also taking place at those\ntimes, thereby eroding the ideological basis for a highly visible state involvement\nin the economy. 257\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nMoreover, the poor economic performance under the military rule meant that a\ncommand economy had not been viable. It was even argued that ‘war and Derg’s\npolicies had left a crippled economy and an impoverished people’. Consequently,\nthough the incoming force, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic\nFront (EPRDF) which toppled the Derg, was a socialist in words and deeds, it was\nneither willing nor capable of ignoring such a visible change of circumstances. The national and international situation at the relevant time (1991) was not\nconducive to governments with communist inclinations. Therefore, the EPRDF\nled Transitional Government adopted a market-led economic policy within six\nmonths after assuming power, an economic policy which was incompatible with\nits former Albanian style political orientation.",

Hence, privatization of state\nowned enterprises was commenced. In conformity with this political and\neconomic disposition, a new labour proclamation which repealed that of the\nmilitary government was issued in 1993. It was stated in the preamble for the\nproclamation that one of the rationales for its adoption was to ensure compliance\nof the labour law with the international [ILO] conventions and other legal\ncommitments to which Ethiopia is a party. More specifically where freedom of association is concerned, in contrast with the\nprevious law which only granted the right to form association to the employees,\nthe right to establish organisations was recognized and became even-handedly\navailable both to employers and employees. From the employees’ perspective, the\nminimum level of membership to form a first-level trade union was maintained\nat twenty by the Labour Proclamation of 1993. Moreover, subordination of basic\ntrade unions to that of the higher levels was an express requirement for unions\nto operate. Finally, protection against anti-union discrimination was been\nexplicitly legislated for the benefit of trade unionists and trade union leaders. 258\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nThis did not mean, however, the removal of all direct potential administrative\ncontrol. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, an administrative organ, was\nempowered to cancel the registration of an association by providing thirty days\nprior notice specifying the reason(s) for cancellation and the opportunity to\nchallenge it (Article 120). This stipulation was inconsistent with the ILO\njurisprudence which expressly stated that ‘administrative dissolution of trade\nunion organisations constitutes a clear violation of Article 4 of Convention No.87’\nto which Ethiopia is a party. Furthermore, the mono-union policy of the military\nregime was also carried over to the new labour proclamation. However, with the adoption of Labour Proclamation No.377/2003 and the repeal\nto Proclamation No. 42/1993, further liberalisation towards union formation and\nadministration has been observed. Accordingly, the minimum membership level\nto form a basic trade union has been again reduced to ten. This change further\npaved the way for employees of small enterprises to unionise. The possibility of\nforming more than one trade union in an enterprise (plurality of unions’ policy)\nhas also been expressly legislated for.",

    "text": "Moreover, since the issuance of the Labour Proclamation of 2003, the power of\nthe administrative organ to cancel the registration of an association has been\nwithdrawn. As a result, it is the regular court, consistent with the prescription of\nthe ILO jurisprudence, which has the power to decide on cancellation of\nregistration issues. The right of the administrative body is limited to making\napplication to the court to order cancellation of an association. With these\nlegislative reforms, many of the outstanding issues as to the non-conformity of\nthe previous laws with ILO standards have been positively addressed. Nevertheless, it may also be argued that the current labour law brought a fresh\nproblem of its own from the standpoint of a suitable legal framework for trade\nunionism. This is associated with the exclusion of the management staff from\njoining trade unions and how the ‘management staff’ is defined. The ILO\njurisprudence accepts the exclusion of ‘management and supervisory staff’ from\nunion membership of non-managerial employees as managerial employees are\n259\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nbelieved to be representing the interest of the employer at workplaces. However,\nthe Committee on Freedom of Association of the ILO Governing Body is of the\nview that “(…) the categories of such staff [the management staff] are not to be\ndefined so broadly as to weaken the organizations of other workers in the\nenterprise or branch of activity by depriving them of a substantial proportion of\ntheir present or potential membership.” Similarly, the ILO Committee of Experts\non the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has been of the view\nthat the “scope for managerial staff should not be defined so widely as to weaken\ntrade unions by depriving them of a substantial proportion of their potential\nmembership.” It should be recalled that the labour proclamations of the previous regime (i.e.\nthe military government) defined the ‘management staff’ from the organisational\nstructure perspective whereby “only those officials directly accountable to the\nGeneral Manager or his [her] deputy were categorized within it and hence\nexcluded from trade union membership.” The residual part of the labour force\noutside of this structural linkage was entitled to establish or join trade unions of\ntheir own choosing. Labour Proclamation No. 377/2003, however, defines the “management staff’\nfrom the angle of the function the employee performs rather than the post he\nassumes in the enterprise’s organisational structure (i.e. functional approach).",

    "text": "Accordingly all employees engaged in managerial functions, regardless of their\nstructural position are considered to be members of the management staff. For\nthe purpose of the present law, managerial function includes, inter alia,\npossessing the power to “(…) take disciplinary measure (…).” Disciplinary\nmeasures, for their part, range from the issuing of a written reprimand or - even\nan oral warning for that matter- to imposing disciplinary dismissal decisions. Hence, as far as the formulation of the law is concerned, any employee who is\nauthorised to hand down any or many of such measures is categorized as a\nmember of the management team. According to a senior member of\nConfederation of Ethiopian Trade Union (CETU), the broad definition accorded\nto the ‘management staff’, excluded appreciable number of potential members\n260\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nfrom union membership, thereby making unions weak economically and in\nleadership quality. This has been, however, rectified by the current labour\nproclamation (Proc. No.1156/2019) by narrowing down the definition of\nmanagerial staff to those who exercise genuine managerial functions. 6.2.9. Summary\nAs with the development of organised labour movements elsewhere,\nunionization in Ethiopia was transformed from self-help associations to fully-\nfledged trade unionism over-time. Although Ethiopia was one of the oldest\nmembers of the ILO; and though the ILO Constitution required member states to\naccord freedom of association as a matter of urgent importance, it had to wait for\nforty years (1923-1963) before the introduction of domestic law on freedom of\nassociation. Even after forty years, it could be argued that it was mainly due to\npressure from the labour force together with favourable regional and\ninternational situations rather than governmental political will that the law was\nbrought into being. At a time when many countries in colonial Africa had laws on trade unionism\nthat paved the way for the establishment of vibrant trade unions that were\ninstrumental in the struggle against economic exploitation and colonisation, the\nImperial regime of non-colonised Ethiopia was concerned that organised labour\nwould endanger the very foundation of the absolute monarchy of the royal\ndynasty. The Imperial view was that social peace could be maintained by denying\nthe collective rights rather than granting them. Consequently, it can be said that\nthe fact that Ethiopia was not physically colonised by any foreign power did not\nbring about any better protection for labour rights.",

    "text": "Petitioning the Emperor for\njustice and at times wild-cat strike or threat of strikes was the modality the labour\nmovement had adopted as a course of action. However, with the attempt to introduce modernity to the traditional Ethiopian\nsociety through legal reform in early 1960s, a policy of suppression of trade\nunionism gave way to recognising trade unionism but accompanied by\n261\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nrestrictions from engaging in any political activities. Only apolitical trade unions\nwere tolerated. A dramatic change of direction came with the military period with highly\ncentralized and partisan approach to trade unionism in which politicisation of\ntrade union, ‘mono-trade union system’ and ‘democratic centralism’ in trade\nunion administrative structure were introduced and the right to associate for\nemployers was denied. Finally, the labour law of the post-military rule progressively adopted more\nliberal positions. Thus the general pattern of the legal framework for trade\nunionism has moved from suppression to regulation, and from regulation to over-\nregulation; and finally from over-regulation to minimal regulation. The pattern\nreflected the economic and political disposition of the three regimes in that the\nover-regulation was associated with the command economy of the military rule;\nwhile the minimalist regulation has been correlated with the market oriented\neconomy. Generally, though the development has been slow and incremental, and at times\nregistering significant regression, the general trend is that the ILO conventions\non freedom of association have positively influenced the contents of the\nsuccessive Ethiopian formal labour laws as many of the stipulations of the\nconventions have been incorporated over-time. However, due to lack of uniform\nand consistent policy towards unionization by the three successive Ethiopian\nregimes, industrial associations have been weak owing to lack of consistency and\ncontinuity. Unlike the colonial and post-colonial Africa where vibrant labour movements\nexisted in many countries, labour movement in Ethiopia has not been strong and\nvocal in economic, social or political issues. However, the fact that the labour\nforce was concentrated in the ‘industrial corridor’ which is also in close proximity\nto the centre of the politics pressed successive regimes in Ethiopia to put the\nlabour force at close surveillance. In practical terms, compared to its counterparts\n262\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nelsewhere in the African continent, organized labour’s role in the political arena\nwas very minimal except during the time of the military regime where they were\nconsidered as vigilante group to protect nationalised means of production.",

    "text": "*****************************\nProblem for discussion:\n1. What have been some of the causes for the unevenness in the\ndevelopment of trade unionism in Ethiopia? 2. Some tend to argue that freedom of association in enterprises is a\nmanifestation of “industrial democracy”. According to them, industrial\ndemocracy \nis \nhelpful \nto \nproductivity, \nprofitability \nand\ncompetitiveness. They even attempt to establish analogy between\ndemocratic states and unionized enterprises. It is argued that\ndemocratic states have been peaceful, prosperous and developed; while\ndictatorial regimes have been destabilized, poor and under-developed. Similarly, the argument goes, unionized enterprises are cooperative,\nproductive and competitive; whereas non-unionized enterprises are\nconfrontational, devoid of industrial peace and less productive. What\nis your view? 3. Why have trade unions not been as vocal as in Ethiopia as in other\nAfrican countries? It is well understood that unionization is not an end by itself. It is rather mainly\nto protect and promote one’s interest that employees embark upon unionization. Once unionization is achieved, the next step would be entering into collective\nbargaining with the other party (i.e. employer or employers’ association). The\nnext chapter will be devoted towards analysing procedures and processes to\n263\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\ncollective bargaining. It will discuss the scope and status of collective agreement\nwhich is the desired outcome of collective bargaining as well. 264\nChapter VII\nCollective Bargaining and Collective Agreement in Ethiopia\n7.1. General\nAs indicated above, it must be underlined that formation of an association is not\nan end by itself. It is in view of defending and furthering the interests of the\ncollective body that an association is mainly established. Thus, association though\nnecessary, is not sufficient to serve its intended purpose. Undertaking collective\nbargaining and concluding collective agreement are important steps towards\nachieving this final goal. As mentioned in Chapter 6 of this text, the right to collective bargaining has been\noffered constitutional recognition. The detailed bargaining process, however, is\nto be articulated by ordinary legislation.",

    "text": "To help understand the legal processes\ntowards collective bargaining and collective agreement, let us spell out the\nrelevant provisions of the current labour proclamation:\nArticle 125: Definition\n1) “Collective agreement” means an agreement on conditions of work\nconcluded in writing between one or more trade unions and one or more\nemployers or representatives or agents of employers’ associations. 2) “Collective bargaining” means a negotiation process between employers\nand workers organizations or their representatives concerning conditions\nof work in order to reach at collective agreement or the renewal or\nmodifications thereof. The right to bargain freely with employers with respect to conditions of work\nconstitutes an essential element in freedom of association, and trade unions\nshould have the right, through collective bargaining or other lawful means, to\nseek to improve the living and working conditions of those whom the trade\nunions represent. The public authorities should refrain from any interference\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nwhich would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Any such\ninterference would appear to infringe the principle that workers’ and employers’\norganizations should have the right to organize their activities and formulate\ntheir programmes. In the Ethiopian legal framework, establishment of trade unions is a pre-\ncondition in order to undertake collective bargaining because as can be gathered\nfrom the definition above, collective bargaining is to be conducted between an\nemployer or employers’ association on the one hand; and trade unions or their\nrepresentatives on the other. There does not seem a room for recognition,\nregistration and enforcement of collective agreements, negotiated and signed by\nnon-unionized workers. Moreover, the Labour Proclamation anticipates the free\nchoice of bargaining level in the sense that sector-level or regional-level\ncollective bargainings is possible and lawful, in the Ethiopian current practice,\nhowever, negotiations are enterprise level. In some jurisdictions, even if there is no trade union in the enterprise, non-\nunionized workers could still nominate representatives and negotiate with their\nemployer. In fact, the Committee on Freedom of Association does not object to\nthis practice. The Committee’s concern is in cases where there exists a trade\nunion and the employer engages in direct negotiation with the employees by-\npassing the representatives of the trade union because such practice would be\ncontrary to the Convention’s objective that is encouragement and promotion of\neffective collective bargaining.",

The other issue associated with collective bargaining is in cases where more than\none union have been formed in an enterprise with whom would an employer be\nobliged to bargain in good faith. One possible solution would be to entitle every\nunion to bargain with the employer with respect to working conditions of its\nmembers. However, this proposition has some limitations. First, under this\narrangement, the employer would be compelled to undertake multiple\nnegotiations in which substantial part of its managerial time would be spent in\nnegotiating. Second, an employer may be pressed to accept heterogenous working\nconditions at enterprise level as every trade union may propose differing working\nconditions. This outcome is undesirable to the employer since it would like to\nhave homogenous working condition at enterprise level. ILO jurisprudence has proposed a solution in such circumstances. It is adopted a\nworking system that states that “the most representative union shall be the\nexclusive bargaining agent”. This proposition again raises new issues to be\nresolved: How to determine the most representative union? And what does\nexclusive bargaining agent mean? This will take us to ILO jurisprudence again. The Committee of Experts of the\nILO Governing Body stated that it is not necessarily incompatible with the\nConvention to provide for the certification of the most representative union in a\ngiven unit as the exclusive bargaining agent for that unit. This is the case,\nhowever, only if a number of safeguards are provided. The Committee has\npointed out that in several countries in which the procedure of certifying unions\nas exclusive bargaining agents has been established, it has been regarded as\nessential that such safeguards should include the following:\n268\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n- certification to be made by an independent body;\n- the representative organizations to be chosen by a majority vote of the\nemployees in the unit concerned;\n- the right of an organization which fails to secure a sufficiently large number of\nvotes to ask for a new election after a stipulated period;\n- the right of an organization other than the certified organizations to demand a\nnew election after a fixed period, often twelve months, has elapsed since the\nprevious election.",

    "text": "Similarly, the Ethiopian labour proclamation stipulates that where there exist\nmore than one trade unions at a given undertaking, the trade union which will\nbe the exclusive bargaining agent and undertake consultation with authorities, is\nthe one which secures 50% plus [and more than] one membership of all the\nemployees of the undertaking (Article 115(1)(a); and if an organization\nsubsequently failed to secure the majority membership of workers, the other\norganization that secure majority shall be recognized instead (Article 115(1)(c ). Finally, if there is no union covering more than 50% of the workers in a unit, the\nsolution offered by the Committee on Freedom of Association is, collective\nbargaining rights should nevertheless be granted to the unions in this unit, at\nleast on behalf of their own members. Ethiopian law is silent on this issue. What\nway out do you propose? Do you subscribe to the solution offered by the\nCommittee? Why? Why not? Article 132: Registration of collective agreement\n1) Upon signing a collective agreement, the parties shall send sufficient\ncopies of same to the Ministry or the appropriate authority for registration. 2) Unless there exists a valid reason to deny registration, the Ministry or the\nappropriate authority shall register the collective agreement within 15\nworking days from the date of receipt of copies thereof. 269\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nArticle 134: Duration and validity of collective agreement\n1) Any provision of a collective agreement which provides for conditions of\nwork and benefits which are less favourable than those provided for\nunder this Proclamation or other laws shall have no effect. 2) Unless otherwise provided therein, a collective agreement shall produce\nlegal effect as of the date of signing by the parties. 3) Unless expressly stipulated otherwise in a collective agreement, no party\nmay challenge the collective agreement within three years from the date\nof its validity. Problem for discussion:\nArticle 27(1)(k) envisages that a collective agreement may stipulate \nadditional grounds for dismissing of an employee without notice other than \nthose grounds of termination provided by law. This implies collect \nagreement can bring in less favourable terms (i.e. additional grounds for \nsummary dismissal) to the employee. On the other hand, Article 134(1) prescribes that “any provision of a \ncollective agreement which provides for conditions of work and benefits \nwhich are less favourable than those provided for under this Proclamation \nor other laws shall have no effect.” Is there any inconsistency between the two provisions of the same \ninstrument?",

Collective bargaining, as was only to be expected, has felt the impact of the major\nchanges affecting the world over the past 25 years: the general acceptance of the\nmarket economy following the fall of the Berlin wall; the debate on the role and\nstructure of the state; economic restructuring and globalization; the ready\navailability of efficient ways of fighting inflation;  the growth of non-standard\nforms of work and temporary contracts; the on-going process of political and\nsocial democratization; the growing autonomy of trade unions from political\nparties, and many other factors too numerous to mention. All these factors have had a varied and significant impact on collective\nbargaining. The scope of collective bargaining in terms of the categories covered\nhas diminished, owing to, inter alia, high levels of unemployment and the\ngrowth of the informal sector, of subcontracting and of the various forms of non-\nstandard employment relationship (which make unionization more difficult);\nthere has, however, been a certain tendency for collective bargaining to develop\nin the public sector. Collective bargaining has lost some of its margin for\nmanoeuvre as a result of the successive economic crises and the subjection of\nnational economic policy to processes of rationalization and economic\nintegration and agreement with the Bretton Woods institutions. The increasingly harsh competition brought about by technological innovation\nand globalization has led to a reduction in the influence exercised in many\ncountries by sectoral agreements and has given added importance to collective\nbargaining at the enterprise level (and at lower levels, such as the work unit, the\nfactory or the workplace), strictly taking into account the criteria of productivity\nand output. Flexibilization and deregulation of work have thus encouraged the\ngrowth of collective bargaining at enterprise level.",

    "text": "271\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nAt the same time, there has been an increasing need for bilateral and tripartite\nagreements at national level, since certain issues of collective interest cannot be\ntreated in enterprise- or even branch-level bargaining, especially when a\ncountry displays significant regional or sectoral differences. The bilateral or\ntripartite pacts agreed in many countries have a scope reaching beyond\nconditions of work in the strict sense, given that they cover employment,\nvocational training, inflation and other social issues. These agreements enhance\nthe prestige of collective bargaining, as they settle questions formerly covered at\nmost by non-binding consultations between the social partners. The ILO has carried out an enormous amount of standard setting work during\nthe 80 years of its existence as it has sought to promote social justice, and one of\nits chief tasks has been to advance collective bargaining throughout the world. This task was already laid down in the Declaration of Philadelphia, 1944, part of\nthe ILO Constitution, which stated “the solemn obligation of the International\nLabour Organization to further among the nations of the world programmes\nwhich will achieve … the effective recognition of the right to bargaining”. This\nprinciple is embodied in the right to organize and collective bargaining\nConvention, No. 98, which was adopted five years later in 1949, and which since\nhas achieved near-universal acceptance: as of January 2000, the number of\nmember states having ratified it stood at 145, which demonstrates the force of\nthe principles involved in the majority of countries. More recently, in June 1998, the ILO took another step forward by adapting the\nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work and its follow up. This states that “all members, even if they have not ratified the [fundamental]\nConventions, have an obligation, arising from the very fact of membership in the\norganization, to respect, to promote and to realize, in good faith and in\naccordance with the Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental\nrights which are the subject of those [fundamental] Conventions”.

    "text": "The framework within which collective bargaining must take place if it is to be viable\nand effective is based on the principle of the independence and autonomy of the\nparties and the free and voluntary nature of the negotiations; it requires the minimum\npossible level of interference by the public authorities in bipartite negotiations and\ngives primacy to employers and their organizations and workers’ organization by\nrepresentatives of workers, employers and governments. History has shown that the principles contained within this framework have\nretained their validity ever since Convention No. 98 was adopted 50 years ago,\ndespite subsequent radical changes in the world-which is why the present article\nseemed opportune. The purpose of this article is to set out the ILO’s principles of collective\nbargaining as they emerge from the various international standards adopted by\nthe Organization and the comments made by its supervisory bodies (notably the\nCommittee of Experts on the application of conventions and Recommendations\nand the Committee on Freedom of Association). The definition and purpose of\ncollective bargaining, the workers and subjects covered will first be set out. Then\nfollow the principles of voluntary negotiation and good faith, the intervention\nof the authorities and the particular case of the public service. Finally, a summary\nof the principles is presented along with some final observations on the degree\nto which the right to collective bargaining is applied across the world. Definition and purpose of collective bargaining\nIn the ILO’s instruments, collective bargaining is deemed to be the activity or\nprocess leading up to the conclusion of a collective agreement. In\nRecommendation No. 91, paragraph 2, collective agreements are defined as:\nAll agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of\nemployment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or\n273\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\none or more representative workers’ organizations, or, in the absence of\nsuch organizations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and\nauthorized by them in accordance with national laws and regulations,\non the other hand. ( ILO, 1996b, p.656). The text goes on to state that collective agreements should bind the signatories\nthereto and those on whose behalf the agreement is concluded and that\nstipulations in such contracts of employment which are contrary to a collective\nagreement should be regarded as null and void and automatically replaced by the\ncorresponding stipulations of the collective agreement. However, stipulations in\ncontracts of employment which are more favourable to the workers than those\nprescribed by a collective agreement should not be regarded as contrary to the\ncollective agreement.

    "text": "91 set out the binding nature of collective\nagreements and their precedence over individual contracts of employment,\nwhile recognizing the stipulations of individual contracts of employment which\nare more favourable for workers. On several occasions, the Committee on Freedom of Association has expressed\nits preference for collective agreements over individual employment contracts,\nobjecting to equal status being given to the latter or to their being used to the\ndetriment of workers belonging to a union. Thus, in a case concerning the United Kingdom, the Committee on Freedom of\nAssociation indicated that avoiding a representative organization and entering\ninto direct individual negotiation with employees is contrary to the promotion\nof collective bargaining. For its part, the Committee of Experts considers that\ngranting primacy to individual agreements over collective agreements does not\nencourage and promote collective bargaining as required by Article 4 of\nConvention No. 98. Convention No.98 does not contain a definition of collective agreements, but\noutlines their fundamental aspects in Article 4:\n274\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nMeasures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken … to\nencourage and promote the full development and utilization of\nmachinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers’\norganizations and workers’ organizations with a view to the regulation\nof terms and conditions of employment by means of collective\nagreements (ILO, 1996b, p. 640). In the preparatory work for Convention No. 151 (1978) the interpretation of the\nterm “negotiation” was accepted as being “any form of discussion, formal or\ninformal, that was designed to reach agreement”, the term “negotiation” being\ndeemed preferable to “discussion”, which did not emphasize the need to\nendeavour to secure agreements. Convention No. 154, adopted in 1981, defines collective bargaining in Article 2\nas follows:\n[T]he term “collective bargaining” extends to all negotiations which\ntake place between an employer, a group of employers or one or more\nemployers’  organizations, on the one hand, and one or more workers’\norganizations, on the other, for: (a) determining working conditions\nand terms of employment;  and/or (b) regulating relations between\nemployers and workers; and/or (c) regulating relations between\nemployers or their organizations and a workers’ organization or\nworkers’ organizations (ILO, 1996d, p. 93).",

This standard\nis set out in paragraph 2 of Recommendation No. 91 and is confirmed in\nConvention No. 135, which provides in Article 5 that “the existence of elected\nrepresentatives is not used to undermine the position of the trade unions\nconcerned or their representatives” ; and in Convention No. 154, which also\nprovides in Article 3, paragraph 2, that “appropriate measures shall be taken,\nwhenever necessary, to ensure that the existence of these [workers’]\nrepresentatives is not used to undermine the position of the workers’\norganizations concerned”. The preparatory work for the collective agreements Recommendation, 1951 (No. 91), shows that the possibility for representatives of workers to conclude\ncollective agreements in the absence of one or various representative\norganizations of workers is envisaged in the recommendation, “taking into\nconsideration the position of those countries in which trade union organizations\nhave not yet reached a sufficient degree of development, and in order to enable\nthe principles laid down in the Recommendation to be implemented in such\ncountries”. The Committee on Freedom of Association maintained in one case that “direct\nsettlements signed between an employer and a group of non-unionized workers,\neven when a union exists in the undertaking, does not promote collective\nbargaining as set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98”. Going into greater\ndetail, in another case, the Committee on Freedom of Association stated that the\npossibility for staff delegates who represent 10 per cent of the workers to\nconclude collective agreements with an employer, even where one or more\norganizations of workers already exist, is not conductive to the development of\ncollective bargaining in the sense of Article 4 of Convention No. 98.",

It is important to emphasize that, for workers’ organizations to be able to fulfil\ntheir purpose of “furthering and defending the interests of workers” through\ncollective bargaining, they have to be independent and must be able to organize\ntheir activities without any interference by the public authorities which would\nrestrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. Moreover, they must not\nbe “under the control of employers or employers’ organizations.” In this respect, Convention No. 151 provides in Article 5 that “public employees’\norganizations shall enjoy complete independence from public authorities”, while\nRecommendation No. 91 indicates in paragraph 2 that “nothing in the present\ndefinition [of collective agreements] should be interpreted as implying the\nrecognition of any association of workers established, dominated or financed by\nemployers or their representatives”.

The Committee of Experts has stated that:\n[W]hen national legislation provides for a compulsory procedure for recognizing\nunions as exclusive bargaining agents [representing all the workers, and not just\ntheir members], certain safeguards should be attached, such as: (a) the\ncertification to be made by an independent body; (b) the representative\norganization to be chosen by a majority vote of the employees in the unit\nconcerned; (c) the right of an organization, which in a previous trade union\nelection failed to secure a sufficiently large number of votes, to request a new\nelection after a stipulated period; (d) the right of any new organization other\nthan the certified organization to demand a new election after a reasonable\nperiod has elapsed.

With regard to this type of public servants, the Committee of\nExperts has stated the following:\nThe Committee could not allow the exclusion from the terms of the\nConvention of large categories of workers employed by the state merely\non the grounds that they are formally placed on the same footing as\npublic officials engaged in the administration of the state. The\ndistinction must therefore be drawn between, on the one hand, public\nservants who by their functions are directly employed in the\nadministration of the state (for example, in some countries, civil\nservants employed in government ministries and other comparable\nbodies, as well as ancillary staff) who may be excluded from the scope\nof the Convention and, on the other hand, all other persons employed\nby the government, by public enterprises or by autonomous public\ninstitutions, who should benefit from the guarantees provided for in the\nConvention.

The concept of working conditions used by the supervisory bodies is not limited\nto traditional working conditions (working time, overtime, rest periods, wages,\netc.), but also covers “certain matters which are normally included in conditions\nof employment”, such as promotions, transfers, dismissal without notice, etc. This trend is in line with the modern tendency in industrialized countries to\nrecognize “managerial” collective bargaining concerning procedures to resolve\nproblems, such as staff reductions, changes in working hours and other matters\nwhich go beyond terms of employment in their strict sense. According to the Committee of Experts, “it would be contrary to the principles\nof Convention No. 98 to exclude from collective bargaining certain issues such\nas those relating to conditions of employment” and “measures taken unilaterally\nby the authorities to restrict the scope of negotiable issues are often incompatible\nwith the Convention”.",

They have also taken\naccount of the underlying concern in much legislation to avoid unnecessary\nstrikes and precarious and tense situations resulting from the failure to renew\ncollective agreements, particularly where they cover extensive categories of\nworkers. Free choice of bargaining level\nIn this respect, Recommendation No. 163 provides that “measures adapted to\nnational conditions should be taken, if necessary, so that collective bargaining is\npossible at any level whatsoever, including that of the establishment, then\n282\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nundertaking, the branch of activity, the industry, or the regional or national\nlevels”. Similarly, the Committee of Experts, after recalling that the right to bargain\ncollectively should also be granted to federations and confederations, and\nrejecting any prohibition of the exercise of this right, has stated that:\n[L]egislation which makes it compulsory for collective bargaining to\ntake place at a higher level (sector, branch of activity, etc.) also raises\nproblems of compatibility with the partners themselves, since they are\nin the best position to decide the most appropriate bargaining level,\nincluding, if they so wish, by adopting a mixed system of framework\nagreements supplemented by local or enterprise level agreements.",

    "text": "The Committee on Freedom of Association has developed this point further\nalong the following lines:\nAccording to the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining\nembodied in Article 4 of Convention No. 98, the determination of the\nbargaining level is essentially a matter to be left to the discretion of the\nparties and, consequently, the level of negotiation should not be\nimposed by law, by decision of the administrative authority or by the\ncase-law of the administrative authority or by the case-law of the\nadministrative labour authority. … Thus, the Committee does not consider the refusal by employers to\nbargain at a particular level as an infringement of freedom of\nassociation. Legislation should not constitute an obstacle to collective\nbargaining at the industry level. In this respect, the Committee considers that the requirement of the majority of\nnot only the number of workers, but also of enterprises, in order to be able to\nconclude a collective agreement on the branch or occupational level could raise\nproblems with regard to the application of Convention No. 98. The Committee\n283\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nof Experts shares this view. Furthermore, it should be sufficient for the trade\nunion at the branch-level to establish that it is sufficiently representative at the\nenterprise level. As regards the principle that the parties involved decide by mutual agreement\nthe level at which bargaining should take place, the Committee has noted that,\nin many countries, this question is determined by a body that is independent of\nthe parties themselves. The Committee considers that in such cases the body\nconcerned should be “truly independent”. The supervisory bodies have not established criteria concerning the relationship\nbetween collective agreements at the different levels (which may address the\neconomy in general, a sector or industry, an enterprise or group of enterprises,\nor an establishment or factory); and which may, according to the individual case,\nhave a different geographical scope. In principle, this should depend on the\nwishes of the parties. In practice, the supervisory bodies accept systems in which\nit is left to collective agreements to determine how they are to be coordinated\n(for example, by establishing that a person resolved in one agreement cannot be\ndecided upon at other levels), as well as systems in which legal provisions\ndistribute subjects between collective agreements, give primary to a specific\nlevel, adopt the criteria of the standards which are the most favourable to the\nworkers, or which do not establish criteria and leave these questions to practical\napplication.",

In practice, in situations of extremely serious economic crisis (such\nas situations of war or in the subsequent periods of economic reconstruction) or\nin order to combat inflation, achieve a balance of payments or combat\nunemployment or other economic objectives, governments have resorted to\nrestrictive policies on wages and incomes.

    "text": "Restrictions on future negotiations\nThe Committee of Experts has noted that, in the belief that the national\neconomic situation requires stabilization measures, an increasing number of\n289\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\ngovernments have taken steps to restrict or prevent the free fixing of wages by\nmeans of collective bargaining. In this respect, the Committee of Experts has\nestablished the following basic principle. [I]f, under an economic stabilization or structural adjustment policy,\nthat is for imperative reasons of national economic interest, wage rates\ncannot be fixed freely by means of collective bargaining, these\nrestrictions should be applied as an exceptional measure and only to the\nextent necessary, should not exceed a reasonable period and should be\naccompanied by adequate safeguards to protect effectively the standard\nof living of the workers concerned, in particular those who are likely to\nbe the most affected (ILO, 1994a, para. 260). The Committee on Freedom of Association has expressed itself in very similar\nterms and has added that, in any case, any limitation on collective bargaining by\nthe authorities should be preceded by consultations with the workers’ and\nemployers’ organizations in an effort to obtain their agreement. The Committee has indicated that the basic principle with regard to wage\nrestrictions in the context of stabilization policies and the required guarantees\nare also applicable in cases in which the law obliges future collective agreements\nto respect productivity criteria, or the negotiation of wage increases beyond the\nlevel of the increase in the cost of living. With regard to the duration of restrictions on collective bargaining, the\nCommittee has considered that a three-year period of limited collective\nbargaining on remuneration within the context of a policy of economic\nstabilization constitutes a substantial restriction, and the legislation in question\nshould cease producing effects at the latest at the dates mentioned in the\nlegislation, or indeed earlier if the fiscal and economic situation improves. Similarly, where wage restraint measures are taken by a government to impose\nfinancial controls, care should be taken to ensure that collective bargaining on\nnon-monetary matters can be pursued. 290\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nCollective bargaining in the public service\nThe exercise of the right of freedom of association by organizations of public\nofficials and employees is now a reality in industrialized countries and in many\ndeveloping countries.

The right to collective bargaining is a fundamental right endorsed by\nthe members of the ILO in joining the organization, which they have\nan obligation to respect, to promote and to realize, in good faith (ILO\nDeclaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work and its\nfollow-up)\nB. Collective bargaining is a right of employers and their organizations, on\nthe one hand, and organizations of workers, on the other hand (first-\nlevel trade unions, federations and confederations); only in the absence\nof these latter organizations may representatives of the workers\nconcerned conclude collective agreements. C. The right to collective bargaining should be recognized throughout the\nprivate and public sectors, and it is only the armed forces, the police and\npublic servants engaged in the administration of the state who may be\nexcluded from the exercise thereof (Convention No. 98). D. The purpose of collective bargaining is the regulation of terms and\nconditions of employment, in a broad sense, and the relations between\nthe parties. E. Collective agreements should be binding. It must be possible to\ndetermine terms and conditions of employment which are more\nfavourable than those established by law and preference must not be\ngiven to individual contracts over collective agreements, except where\nmore favourable provisions are contained in individual contracts. 292\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nF. To be effective, the exercise of the right to collective bargaining requires\nthat workers’ organizations are independent and not “under the control\nof employers or employers’ organizations” and that the process of\ncollective bargaining can proceed without undue interference by the\nauthorities. G. A trade union which represents the majority or a high percentage of the\nworkers in a bargaining unit may enjoy preferential or exclusive\nbargaining rights. However, in cases where no trade union fulfils these\nconditions or such exclusive rights are not recognized, workers’\norganizations should nevertheless be able to conclude a collective\nagreement on behalf of their own members.",

In view of the fact that the voluntary nature of collective bargaining is\na fundamental aspect of the principles of freedom of association,\ncollective bargaining may not be imposed upon the parties and\nprocedures to support bargaining must, in principle, take into account\nits voluntary nature; moreover, the level of bargaining must not be\nimposed unilaterally by law or by the authorities, and it must be possible\nfor bargaining to take place at any level.

After closely reading the extensive piece reproduced above, to what extent are\nILO principles concerning collective bargaining incorporated in the current\nEthiopian labour law? 2. The Ethiopian legal framework for collective bargaining prescribes that each\nparty to a collective bargaining has not only the duty to bargain but also the\nduty to bargain in good faith(Article 131(2) and(4)). These provisions seem to\nhave introduced “mandatory bargaining” on the parties. On the other hand the\nrelevant ILO instruments provide that bargaining should be a voluntary\nengagement of the parties and cannot be imposed on the parties. Consequently,\n294\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nsome contend that by making bargaining mandatory, Ethiopian law deviates\nfrom the ILO jurisprudence in this regard. Others, for their part, argue that as\nlong as the duty to agree is not imposed on the parties, compelling them to\nbargain does not have any wrong. It is merely assisting towards making\ncollective bargaining effective. What is your view? 3. Assume that representatives of the trade union and the employer agreed to\nundertake collective bargaining. Further assume that they drew up the\nprocedure for discussion and as an item for such procedure it was stated that\nevery discussion and points of agreement should be written down in minutes. Minutes of the previous discussion were to be adopted at the commencement\nof the next day of the meeting. This procedure went smoothly as prescribed by\nthe procedure. All items presented for bargaining were discussed and agreed. Nevertheless, when the representative of the employer was required to put her\nsignature on the draft collective agreement, she refused to do so stating that\nshe had changed her mind regarding some of the terms. Should the employer\nbe compelled to sign or would there be any other way out? (Please refer to:  Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division decision on “Fincha\nSugar Factory v.

Although ILO Convention No.98 on the Right to Organise and Collective\nBargaining did not itself provide a definition as to how ‘collective bargaining’\nshould be understood, the Collective Bargaining Convention (No.154 of 1981),\ndefines it in the following manner in Article 2:\nThe term ‘collective bargaining’ extends to all negotiations which take\nplace between an employer, a group of employers or one or more\nemployers’ organisations on the one hand, and one or more workers’\norganisations, on the other, for: (a) determining working conditions and\nterms of employment; and/or (b) regulating relations between\nemployers and workers; and/or (c) regulating relations between\nemployers or their organisations and a workers’ organisation or\nworkers’ organisations.’ By negotiation, Article 2 means any formal or informal discussion between the\nsocial partners with a view to arriving at an agreement on issues of common\ninterest and benefit. Collective bargaining has served as a method or process of\nrule making of a private nature which is intended to regulate the relations of\nnegotiating parties. Collective bargaining is also a way of attaining beneficial and\nproductive solutions to potentially confrontational relations between the social\npartners. In effect, collective bargaining is a process in which the social partners\nto industrial relations may regulate and manage their industrial relations by their\nown through a ‘give and take’ mode of operation. Letting the parties bargain does not, however, imply that the state has no role in\ncollective bargaining. On the contrary, it has an irreplaceable role in establishing\na suitable environment for the parties by laying down the basic rules of the game\n296\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nfor negotiation; and in some cases to mediate and conciliate the negotiating\nparties, if and when the need arises. There are jurisdictions where organs of the\nstate have been entrusted with the responsibility to enforce the terms of the\ncollective agreement and provide sanctions for breach of the agreements in a\nmanner similar to any other breach of contract.",

    "text": "Conversely, some other systems\nrely on extra-judicial sanctions such as industrial action for the enforcement of\nthe terms of collective agreement. Generally, collective bargaining is a regulatory\nmechanism of private nature for industrial relations. In a sense, it is an aspect of\n“private ordering.” As indicated earlier, many states intervened in individual employment relations\nby prescribing substantive benefits in the form of ‘minimum employment\nconditions’ that employers are required to ‘meet or exceed’ in their dealings with\nindividual employees. The nature of state intervention in collective bargaining\nis, however, primarily limited to drawing up procedural mechanisms to be\ncomplied with by the parties when seeking to reach an agreement. It is for the\nparties to determine and fix the substantive matters by themselves. While the\nintervention of the State in individual employment relations is mainly\nprescribing the minimum terms, it usually has more of a procedure formulating\nrole in cases of collective bargaining. However, the sort of facilitative role by the state suggested above is not\ninevitable. Indeed, in earlier periods of industrial relations, collective bargaining\nwas considered as a “restraint of trade” and hence inconsistent with then\nprevailing free market economic philosophy. It was feared that such ‘concerted\naction’ of employees would give a monopolistic power to employees to take away\nprofit and power from employers and was viewed with hostility by employers. As a result, both the formation of trade unions and collective bargaining were\nheld to be undesirable working systems, with market distortion effects, within\nthe framework of the freedom of contract and market oriented economy. In fact,\nsuch an understanding persists even in recent times. 297\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nEven after unionization was tolerated and had eventually permitted, collective\nbargaining did not necessarily operate simultaneously with unionization because\n“recognition” of trade unions for collective bargaining purposes remained at the\ndiscretion of the employers. In such an arrangement well organised and strong\ntrade unions succeeded in bringing reluctant employers to the bargaining table\nthrough collective action or the threat of such action. Conversely, poorly-\norganised and weak unions did not succeed in obtaining recognition from\nemployers. Therefore, the decision whether or not to undertake collective\nbargaining was the private decision of the parties, mainly of the employers. Within the ILO legal framework, the scope of the right to collective bargaining\nlacked sufficient clarity. Even though the ILO Constitution of 1919 had an\nexplicit statement on the right to freedom of association, it was silent about the\nissue of collective bargaining.",

    "text": "Similarly, although the Philadelphia Declaration\n(1944), which has been an integral part of the ILO Constitution, indicates ‘the\nrecognition of effective collective bargaining’, it was not made part of the four\nfundamental principles on which the Organisation is based. Moreover, ILO Convention No. 87, which regulates the right to freedom of\nassociation in a detailed manner, is directed towards regulating the autonomy and\nindependence of associations from governmental interference rather than\nregulating the relationship of the social partners. Article 10 of the Convention\nmerely indicated the objective for formation of association to be “furthering and\ndefending the interest of the members.” More importantly, the ILO Convention\nNo.98 of 1949 on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining failed to\nexpressly provide for the right to collective bargaining. It rather limited its\nregulatory scope to the prohibition of interference by the social partners with\neach other and prohibits anti-union discriminations of various types. Therefore,\nat the international level too, the right to collective bargaining was not expressly\nspelt out, even if freedom of association was regulated and legally recognized. It may be argued that in most cases formation of association is not an end in itself. It is rather to protect members’ interests that associations are formed. It could,\n298\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nthus be contended that freedom of association should be interpreted to include\nthe right to collective bargaining because one of the measures for ensuring\nmembers’ interest is believed to be collective bargaining. The Committee on\nFreedom Association of the ILO Governing Body has interpreted the right to\nfreedom of association to encompass  “the right to bargain freely with employers\nwith respect to conditions of work as it constitutes an essential element in\nfreedom of association” (…). At supra-national level, a similar conclusion has been reached by the European\nCourt of Human Rights, while interpreting Article 11 (1) of the European Human\nRights Convention, which is similarly phrased to that of other human right\ninstruments. Accordingly, the Court in Demir and Bayraka v. Turkey, through\nthe evolution of case law, held that “the right to bargain collectively with the\nemployer has, in principle, become one of the essential elements of the rights to\nform and to join trade unions for the protection of one’s interests.” It might even be noted that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has taken the\ninterpretation a step further.",

    "text": "The ECJ in disposing cases before it such as Viking\nand Laval consistently held that the right to freedom of association stipulated in\nthe various international and regional instruments implicitly grants the\nfundamental right to collective action. Indeed, the Court interpreted the phrase\n‘collective action’ not only in the limited sense of collective bargaining but\nfurther extended its meaning to include the right to strike. As a result, although\nthere is no explicit provision on the right to collective bargaining in the various\ninstruments, through a purpose-oriented interpretation, the right to collective\nbargaining was read into “the right to form or join a trade union to protect one’s\ninterest.” The Ethiopian legal system, as will be seen below, has expressly\nrecognized the right to collective bargaining both in its Constitution and labour\nlaws rather than relying in the interpretation of the enforcement machineries. However, even when the right to collective bargaining is recognized expressly or\nimplicitly, there remains another outstanding issue. Whether the right to\ncollective bargaining for one party would impose a duty on the other party to\n299\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nappear for bargaining against its will needs to be considered. In this connection,\nthe Committee on Freedom of Association has held that ‘Member States should\nensure collective bargaining assumes a voluntary character and not entail\nrecourse to measures of compulsion which would alter the voluntary nature of\nsuch bargaining’. This seems to imply that collective bargaining is a juridical act\nthat should be entered into voluntarily and hence neither party would be\ncompelled to bargain against its will. Similarly, Gernigon et al have contended\nthat collective bargaining may not be imposed by law on the parties. The European Court of Human Rights appeared to have held similar position in\nthis regard. In Wilson v. UK, while interpreting Article 11 (1) of the European\nConvention of Human Rights, the Court accepted that the right to organise and\njoin trade unions for the protection members’ interests should enable trade\nunions to engage in collective action towards that end. However, the Court stated\nthat Article 11(1) should not be construed as imposing an obligation on the\nemployer to engage in collective bargaining against its will. The Court was of the\nview that the Convention did not impose a duty on an employer (a private actor)\nto bargain without its consent. The Convention merely obligates the State, the\npublic power, to ensure that unions are not prevented from representing their\nmembers in negotiations with a view to regulating working conditions with their\nemployers.",

    "text": "It is worth noting, however, that Article 4 of ILO Convention No. 98 obligates\nMember States “to take, where deemed necessary, measures appropriate to\nnational conditions to encourage and promote the use of collective bargaining\nwith a view to regulating conditions of employment.” It seems to offer “a margin\nof discretion” to nation states to undertake measures, including legislative\nmeasures, which they consider necessary and feasible in order to encourage and\npromote collective bargaining appropriate to their particular circumstances. This\ninterpretation has been reinforced by Article 5 (1) of the ILO Convention No.154\nwhich prescribed that “measures adapted to national conditions shall be taken to\npromote collective bargaining’ in order to make collective bargaining practicable\nand effective” (emphasis added). As a result, it could be argued that Member\n300\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nStates are within their duty of promoting collective bargaining if they prescribe\nmandatory procedures for collective bargaining so long as they do not impose an\nobligation on the parties to reach an agreement. It thus seems that how to encourage and promote collective bargaining has been\nleft to Member States as a result of which they are entitled to come up with\nfacilitative legislation towards bargaining. In fact, Schregle contended that “in\nmost countries of the Third World [developing countries] governments cannot\nsit back and adopt a purely passive role in industrial relations but must, in a spirit\nof innovation and imagination, take the initiative in promoting sound industrial\nrelations through legislation and promotional action.” Due to these divergent views as to the scope of the right to collective bargaining,\nnational labour laws adopt heterogeneous positions. In some jurisdictions the\nright to bargain collectively merely imposes a negative duty not to interfere in\nthe other party’s collective representations; while in others, it goes as far as\nimposing a positive duty to bargain on the other party at the pain of sanction. In\nparticular, the desire of nation states to maintain harmonious industrial relations\nand to avoid or limit frequent industrial action compels them to resort not only\nto draw up a facilitative legal framework for bargaining but also to impose a duty\non the social partners to bargain. In support of such a pro-active governmental\nmeasure, Cox remarked that:\nBy imposing the duty to bargain what the law actually does is to escort\nthe trade union representatives to the door of the employer and say,\n‘here they are, the legal representatives of your employees’.",

Similarly, Davies has also been of the view that:\nWhere the union has a high level of support but cannot persuade the\nemployer to bargain, the law should intervene. This would not\ncontradict the inherent voluntariness of negotiations because the law\n301\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nonly forces the employer to take part in the procedure, not to reach a\nparticular agreement. 7.2.2. Current challenges to collective bargaining\nEven though the Convention on the recognition of collective bargaining (1949)\nwas adopted one year after the adoption of the Convention on Freedom of\nAssociation and Protection of the Right to Organize (1948), due to the\ninterdependence of the two instruments, their developmental pattern has been\ninseparably linked. It is contended that effective collective bargaining could be\nbest served in situations where there exists an independent union committed to\nthe interests of its members. In this sense unionization is a basic prerequisite for\ncollective bargaining. Conversely, collective bargaining enables the labour force\nto articulate an organised voice in industrial relations, thereby strengthening\nunity and solidarity of the labour force. There have been challenges of production decentralisation and measures of\nregulatory competition and, at times, hostility towards unionization in the global\neconomic order. Similar challenges are prevalent with respect to collective\nbargaining. In fact, the employers’ uneasiness towards union formation under the\nstiff competition of globalisation mainly emanates from the fear that organised\nlabour will, in the final analysis, seek to establish collective bargaining with a\npossible outcome where the amount of profit and managerial power available to\nthe employer becomes more limited. Thus, it could even be argued that, from the\nemployers’ perspective, it has been mainly to pre-empt collective bargaining that\nunionization has been held at bay. Although it is believed that organised labour is more beneficial to even the\nemployer than a non-organised workforce in terms of productivity, efficiency\nand stability, there still exists in many cases a constant and consistent fear by\nemployers towards unionised labour. The source of such a concern has commonly\nbeen the perception that collective bargaining would enable unions to raise wages\nand other benefits above productivity levels, thereby adversely affecting\n302\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\ncompetitiveness.",

    "text": "In particular, the stiff global competition heightened the extent\nof the fear to the highest level as multiple competitors originating from diverse\nlocations with heterogeneous labour standards compete through international\nmarkets. The perception is that products originating from those jurisdictions\nwhere higher labour standards apply tend to loss competitiveness due to the high\nlabour cost associated with them. “ Employers argue that diminished labour\nstandards are needed in order to be globally competitive.” However, such an\nunderstanding fails to appreciate the fact that low labour costs may be associated\nwith demotivation and low productivity. On the contrary, higher labour\nstandards are also likely to bring about motivated, initiated and productive labour\nforce. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow low labour standards is associated\nwith competitiveness and profitability. Nonetheless it is indisputable that fear of an organised voice in the workplace is\nmanifestly visible in many countries. As manifestations of such a fear, there have\nbeen instances where companies have threatened to relocate if workers propose\ncollective bargaining on the anticipation that collective bargaining may bring\nabout better concessions for the labour force, thereby increasing cost of labour. As mentioned earlier, in the global economic order various multilateral and\nbilateral arrangements and agreements have been put in place and created\nconducive conditions for capital to move freely across national borders with little\nor no restriction. This ease of capital mobility provides capital enhanced\nbargaining leverage against trade unions. Faced with the possible flight of capital\nand jobs, trade unions could not afford to risk taking an action detrimental to the\ninterest of their members. Hence, there are views that the role of collective\nbargaining and the power of trade unions in protecting the interests of labour\nhave been on the decline. The general impression is that collective bargaining\nhas been weakened as globalisation “boosts the bargaining [power] of capital at\nthe expense of labour.” In addition to the economic factors favouring capital over labour mentioned\nabove, influential supra-national institutions such as the ECJ seem to adopt an\ninterpretation that tended to make the right to collective bargaining subordinate\n303\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nto the right to the freedom of movement of capital and other economic freedoms.

    "text": "According to the Court, without prejudice to its fundamental nature,\ncollective action should not be exercised and applied in a manner that will restrict\n“economic freedoms” emanating from the EU Treaty such as “freedom of\nestablishment” and “freedom to provide services,” thereby granting unfettered\nopportunity of relocation for economic establishments within the borders of\nmember states. Although the ECJ accepted the right to collective action as a fundamental right,\nit, nonetheless, held that collective action is not an absolute right; rather its\nexercise must be reconciled with economic rights such as “freedom of\nestablishment” and freedom to provide services in accordance with the principle\nof proportionality and provided that there is no other least restrictive measure to\nattain the objective. The Court’s view is that “freedom of establishment and\nfreedom to provide services are to be exercised freely while collective action is to\nbe employed on condition that it does not impose disproportionate restriction on\nthese freedoms.” The holding of the Court tended to accord higher emphasis on\nthe economic goals to which social goals can readily be sacrificed. This perspective can also be seen, arguably in a more extreme fashion, in the\napproach of the World Bank (WB). The WB’s influential annual survey entitled\nDoing Business, assesses the level of business friendliness of the various countries\nin the world and allocates grades to them.

This is not to deny that the WB\napproach as manifested in Doing Business may have an adverse effect on\ncollective bargaining but it would be indirect rather than a direct and explicit\none. The approaches of the ECJ and the WB described herein above all tend to suggest\nthat collective bargaining has been exposed to challenges of various legal and\npractical constraints. Moreover, in the domestic setting, though African\nexperience was not included in his national reports, Compa summarized various\nnational reports indicating that in some jurisdictions “national courts have been\ninfluenced by globalisation debate to favour employers’ interests and more\nreceptive to changes in the economic winds,” thereby adopting investment-\nfriendly interpretations at the expense of labour rights. Despite the challenging situation in which collective bargaining has found itself,\nstudies have shown that collective bargaining has been instrumental in creating\nindustrial peace, productivity and equitable income distribution. For instance,\nempirical studies found a positive correlation between workers’ participation in\ndecision making on the one hand and workers’ motivation and productivity on\nthe other. One way of enabling workers to participate in decision making is\nthrough collective bargaining. Palley also argued that ‘(…) by allowing for\nformation of independent trade unions that bargain collectively, recalibration of\nthe system of income distribution could be ensured. Furthermore, Hayter argued\nthat ‘(…) countries with strong collective bargaining institutions including strong\ntrade unions and employers’ organizations, high levels of collective bargaining\ncoverage (…) are those with better measures of income distribution’. Critics of\n305\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nglobalisation accuse the global economic order of aggravating an inequitable\nbenefit sharing within social groups both domestically and among states\ninternationally. It is thus claimed that strengthening collective bargaining\ninstitutions would have added value to the credibility, legitimacy and\nsustainability of the new global economic order. However, under the global economic order the tendency has been mainly to view\ncollective bargaining as a man-made constraint against the smooth and natural\ncourse of the market. Consequently, developing countries and transition\neconomies that are engaged in economic reforms and adjustment programmes\nhave been advised, by multilateral lending and donor institutions, to sidestep\nstrong labour institutions due to the perception that such institutions are\nobstacles to the smooth running of the anticipated reforms.",

    "text": "Presumably by considering the reality\non the ground where capital occupies a strong bargaining position over labour,\nthe ILO began to employ softer terminologies of industrial relations such as\n“social partners” instead of “negotiating parties”; “social dialogue” instead of\n“collective bargaining”; “consultation” instead of “negotiation”; and “consensus”\ninstead of “agreement.” It tries to avoid more forceful tones and binding\narrangements in formulating its recent working documents. It does not mean\nthat the soft and more of cooperation, rather than confrontational, terminologies\nare ineffective to industrial relations. It only means that they tended to manifest\na milder commitment to the concern of collective labour. By realising these facts,\nDavies remarked that “globalization is often regarded as having created an\n“identity crisis” for the ILO.” To sum up, though the positive contributions of collective bargaining in bringing\nabout industrial peace, productivity and competitiveness seemed to obtain\nvisibility to a certain extent; and even though its role in bringing about fair and\n307\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nequitable distribution of wealth and power between the social partners is also\nnoted, it appears that collective bargaining finds itself in a precarious condition. In particular, in the African continent, the role of collective bargaining has\ndiminished due to, among other things, the withdrawal of the state from the\neconomy, the expansion of the informal sector and the casualization of\nemployment. Bearing in mind the above-mentioned broad context, the\nremaining part of this chapter will examine the Ethiopian situation on the subject\nunder discussion. 7.2.3. Evolution of collective bargaining in Ethiopia\nThe proposition that the history of collective bargaining has been co-extensive\nwith the history of unionization since the former would not be meaningful and\neffective in the absence of the latter, seemed to hold true in the Ethiopian\ncontext, too. Undeniably, the workers’ association at the Franco-Ethiopian\nRailroad Company had, since the late 1940s, bargained and obtained concessions\nfrom the employer. This happened prior to the issuance of the 1963 labour law\nthat paved the way for unionization and collective bargaining. However, that was\nan isolated incident rather than a general rule. Even though the 1955 Revised Constitution recognized “the right to freedom of\nassociation” as a constitutional right, the subsequent instrument, the Civil Code\nof 1960, contained provisions only applicable for the establishment of “not-for –\nprofit” civil associations.",

    "text": "Thus, there was no law for the regulation of issues\nrelating to recognition of unions, negotiation procedures, or the scope and status\nof collective agreements. Even where the Civil Code mentioned collective bargaining, the reference was\nformulated in such a way that collective bargaining remained a voluntary\nengagement in which the government undertook no role to prescribe “mandatory\nrecognition” and other rules and procedures for collective bargaining. Thus\nemployers were at liberty to extend or deny recognition to associations of\nemployees. Admittedly, employees of large companies such as the Franco-\n308\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nEthiopian Railroad Company had frequently employed their power of collective\naction in the form of wild-cat strikes to obtain “volunteerism”, thereby bringing\nreluctant employers to the bargaining table. However, the Ethiopian Penal Code\nof 1957, in its Article 570 (1) had the following prescription:\nWhosoever, by intimidation, violence, fraud or any other unlawful\nmeans, whether alone or with others, compels another (…) to refuse or\nwithhold his labour, with the object of imposing on an employer by\nforce the acceptance or modification of terms of employment is\npunishable upon complaint with simple imprisonment or fine. What the express words of that provision of the Penal Code criminalized was\n“intimidation, compulsion, fraudulent act or any other unlawful act upon\nanother.” It could, thus, be argued that persuading another to withhold his\nservice with the object of imposing on the employer terms of employment was\nbeyond the scope of the Penal Code and hence non-punishable. The problem,\nhowever, is, at the margin and in practice, it is difficult to demarcate exactly\nwhere persuasion ends and intimidation or compulsion begins. Although not\n“tried and tested” before our courts, a strike or threat of strike with a view to\nbringing the employer to the bargaining table, theoretically, carried with it a\ncriminal liability at the time. In particular, the fact that the Penal Code of 1957\nwas adopted subsequent to the promulgation of the Revised Constitution of 1955\nplaced the political commitment of the Imperial regime towards collective\nbargaining in a highly questionable position. Even in cases where a collective agreement was signed by the parties, the Civil\nCode required the approval of the collective agreement by “competent public\nauthorities” for its validity. As a result, the parties had no ultimate control over\nthe contents of their collective agreements.",

    "text": "Given the fact that the terms of the\ncollective agreements might have an impact on the general interest of the public\nand the national economy at large, it seemed that government intervention in\ncontent verification was considered appropriate. The approval mechanism might\nalso be necessary in order to ensure that the terms of the collective agreements\n309\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\ndid not fall below the legally stipulated minimum labour condition of the Civil\nCode. Indeed, the duration of the collective agreement was also to be fixed by the law. The duration was limited by law to one year after which either party might\nterminate it by giving six months’ prior notice to the other party even if contrary\nprovisions were spelt out in the collective agreement. Based on these\narrangements, whether to conduct collective bargaining and the manner of\nconducting thereof was left to the decision of the parties. But once collective\nagreement was reached it was no longer the parties’ private affair as the\ncompetent public authorities (the government) were empowered to step in to\ndeal with content verification and determination of the agreement’s life span. Consequently the government appeared to be in a dilemma between regulating\nand deregulating the collective bargaining and its outcome in that it deregulated\nthe process while regulating the substance and the duration of validity. Under\nsubsequent labour laws, as will be seen later, the authority of public authorities\nhas been limited to registering (not to approving) the collective agreements. The\ncontent and the duration of the collective agreement are to be fixed by the parties\n(except that terms of collective agreements which are less favourable than what\nis provided by law or contract will not be given effect) and it is only if and when\nthe parties fail to spell out the duration that the duration stipulated by law (i.e.\nthree years) will serve as a gap filling instrument. In earlier times, the longstanding master and servant mentality of understanding\nthe relationship, in Ethiopia, made some employers reluctant to make themselves\navailable to bargain on an equal footing with their ‘servants.’ There existed\nrecords of various modalities of ‘feet dragging’ tactics from the employers’ side\nwith a view to avoiding, delaying or frustrating collective bargaining\nengagements. For instance, the bargaining process for the first collective\nagreement in Ethiopian labour history which was signed between the Wonji-\nShewa Sugar Factory and the Wonji-Shewa Sugar Factory Trade union, was\nconcluded after eight months of intense negotiation.",

The first-level trade union subsequently reported the matter to the\nnational labour association (CELU) and the latter took up the case with the\nGovernment. The appropriate Government organ invited the employer for\ndiscussions but it failed to appear with impunity. Hence, unionization, in\nEthiopia, did not automatically pave the way towards effective collective\nbargaining. Although the Labour Proclamation of 1963 introduced concepts such\nas ‘recognising each other for bargaining’ and ‘bargaining in good faith’, it did not\nattach any sanctions with a view to making them effective. 7.2.4. Subject matter of collective bargaining in Ethiopia\nThe history of labour movements has shown that the initial objective of collective\nbargaining was just to regulate “working conditions.” Traditionally, the term\n“working conditions” was narrowly understood to mean terms such as working\nhours, overtime pay, rest periods and wages, which were predominantly\neconomic matters. Overtime, however, the scope of collective bargaining began\nto widen to include social issues such as paid leave of different sorts (annual leave,\nmaternity leave, sick leave etc.). Social security benefits and skill development\nmeasures such as education and training have also been included in many\ncollective bargaining tables. A further step is where managerial issues such as\nemployees’ \nrecruitment, \ntransfer, \npromotion, \ndisciplinary \nissues \nand\nretrenchment, all traditionally within ‘managerial prerogatives,’ have been\nincluded in collective bargaining negotiations in many countries. Consequently,\nthe subject matter of collective bargaining has ranged from purely economic\nissues to various aspects of social security and power sharing items with its scope\nof coverage gradually but steadily expanding. In this regard, Schregle observes\nthat:\nDevelopments in many countries in various parts of the world show\nthat collective bargaining is no longer limited to the determination of\nwages and working conditions. More and more matters which, in the\n311\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\npast, were considered management prerogatives are being included in\nthe scope of collective bargaining. The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and\nRecommendations of the ILO held that ‘it would be contrary to the principles of\nConvention No. 98 to exclude from collective bargaining any issue relating to\nconditions of employment.’",

    "text": "However, in connection with the appropriateness of\nemployees’ participation in management, the position is not yet settled. It might\nbe argued that whereas exigencies of business transaction anticipate prompt\ndecision making, employees’ participation in such decisions is likely to have a\ndelaying effect to the detriment of the enterprises’ legitimate business interests. Moreover, shareholders and potential investors may lose confidence in the\ndecision-making process of the enterprise once ‘non-owners’ (i.e. employees) are\ninvolved in decision taking. However, there are compelling reasons to support employees’ participation. As\nSchregle notes “workers are entitled to have a say in the management of their\nenterprises irrespective of ownership simply because they work there” More\npractically mutual understanding of the views and concerns of the parties could\nbe enhanced, as a result of which tensions and industrial disputes could be\nminimized. Employees, it may be claimed, would cultivate an enhanced\ncommitment to the causes of the enterprise and a sense of belonging to the\nenterprise would be improved. Hepple also argued “giving workers a voice\ngenerally improves efficiency.” Unfortunately, Compa’s Report documented that\nin the global economic order the general trend is towards widening\nmanagement’s prerogative to unilaterally run the enterprise by excluding trade\nunion participation on personnel management issues. Turning then to consider how the Ethiopian experience reflects the several points\nraised above, it can be immediately noted that the first labour proclamation that\nrecognized the right to collective bargaining stipulated the subject matter in\ngeneral terms, stating simply that ‘labour conditions’ shall be the objects for\nbargaining. However, apart from providing an illustrative listing as to which\n312\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nsubject matters could be included, the law did not provide a working definition\nfor the phrase ‘labour conditions.’ This tended to imply that the subject matter\nfor bargaining would be demarcated by the parties themselves. This ‘open-ended’\napproach of the law was consistent with the view held by the Committee of\nExperts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations stated above. In reality, however, due to lack of experience and weak organisational set up of\ntrade unions in Ethiopia, at the time, the issues at the bargaining table were no\nmore than “bread and butter” issues, such as wages, over-time pay and working\nhours. Nevertheless, over-time, the subject matter for collective bargaining began to\nbecome more diverse in content. In particular, with the adoption of Proc.",

    "text": "No.64/1975 at the time of the military regime, items for bargaining extended\nbeyond economic issues to cover social and managerial issues. The proclamation\nspecifically stated that improvement of workers’ educational standards and\nvocational skills and workers’ participation in the management of the enterprises\nshall be among the subject matters eligible for collective bargaining. It may be argued that as most of the enterprises during the military rule were\nunder state ownership; such an extensive coverage of bargainable subject matters\nwas intended to apply to those state-owned enterprises. However, the scope of\napplication of the Labour Proclamation was not restricted to state owned\nenterprises. It was applicable to any ‘undertaking’, regardless of ownership issues. Consequently, employees including employees of private enterprises which\nemployed twenty or more employees were entitled to form trade unions and to\ncollectively bargain on the issues identified above. Thus, issues of development\nof employees’ skills and participation in managerial matters, both in state owned\nand private enterprises, which were conventionally within the realm of the\nemployers’ prerogative, were made subject matters open for collective\nbargaining. Since then, collective agreements, in Ethiopia, have begun to insert\nprovisions dealing with employees’ skill development schemes and participation\nin managerial activities in addition to the traditional “bread and butter” issues of\neveryday life. 313\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nThere are countries where the right of employees’ participation in management\nemanates from legislation, not from a collective agreement. For instance, India\nadopts the right of employees’ participation in management by stipulating law to\nthis effect rather than leaving it for collective bargaining. Accordingly, under\nIndian law, employees’ representatives for the purpose are to be elected by the\ngeneral meeting of the labour force (unionised and non-unionised) rather than\nthrough trade unions. Its application was also in enterprises that at least employ\n100 workers. As far as the Ethiopian situation is concerned it is different in this\nrespect. First, the right to participate does not emanate from legislation; rather\nfrom a collective agreement. Second, since a trade union has been the exclusive\nbargaining agent under Ethiopian law, there will not be another organ that will\nbe elected for the purpose of workers’ participation. Third, its application has also\nbeen open to all enterprises, regardless of the number of employees of the\nenterprise, where trade unions are established.",

    "text": "With the overthrow of the military rule and a change of government, to a certain\nextent, an approach similar to that of India emerged as regarding employees’\nparticipation in managerial activities. Based on the Public Enterprises\nProclamation (Proc. No.24/1992), employees’ representatives have been entitled\nto not more than one-third vote in the Managing Board of the enterprise. Employees’ representatives for the Managing Board are also to be elected by the\ngeneral assembly of the labour force even if a trade union exists. On the basis of\nthis arrangement, participation emanates from legislation and the representatives\nare elected from and represent all the employees both unionised and non-\nunionised. Thus, employees at state owned enterprises have obtained a co-\ndecision making power by law. From this perspective, employees’ participation in top management at state\nowned enterprises has been legally guaranteed, rather than being left to the\nnegotiation of the social partners. Nevertheless, as the Public Enterprise\nProclamation applies only to state owned enterprises, this working arrangement\nis applicable only to employees of state owned enterprises. In the private sector,\nemployees’ participation in managerial activities emanates from a collective\n314\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nbargaining. Notwithstanding this variation between State owned and private\nenterprises, the general pattern of the laws of Ethiopia has been gradually but\nconsistently to expand, at least formally the scope and coverage of employees’\nparticipation in the managerial affairs to penetrate deeper into the province of\nthe management prerogatives regardless of the nature of ownership. It should be noted that conducting collective bargaining and concluding\ncollective agreement though necessary are not sufficient achievements unless the\nterms of the collective agreement are implemented and remain stable until\nreplaced. In this regard, the successive labour laws of the country have addressed\nthe issue in the following manner. Under the labour proclamation of 1975 it was\nstated that “unless replaced by legislation or other collective agreement,\nconditions of work, benefits and workers’ right stipulated in a collective\nagreement shall remain in force.” This stipulation was retained by the labour\nproclamation that superseded it. However, this principle of maintaining the status quo until replaced by another\ncollective agreement has been withdrawn since the adoption of the labour\nproclamation of 2003. It has been stipulated that employment conditions\nformulated by an expiring collective agreement will lose their binding force\nunless replaced by another collective agreement within three months from the\nexpiry date of the previous collective agreement.",

    "text": "This recent position of\nEthiopian labour law resembles what Compa observed in other countries’ labour\nlaw reforms. In fact, by an amendment issued in 2006 it is provided that it is not\nthe whole terms of the collective agreement that will cease to be effective, but\nrather those terms of the collective agreement pertaining to ‘wages and other\nbenefits’ (which are of higher importance to the employees) that will lose their\nbinding effect. 7.2.5. The duty to bargain and to bargain in good faith\nAs indicated earlier, the 1963 Labour Proclamation introduced, for the first time\nin Ethiopian labour history, provisions for the formation of employers’ and\n315\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nemployees’ associations. These provisions included the procedures for collective\nbargaining and registration of collective agreements and the definition and\nprohibition of “unlawful labour practices.” Concepts such as “the duty to\nbargain” and “bargaining in good faith” have also been incorporated since then\ninto the Ethiopian labour law. However, the way in which the provision on “the duty of bargaining in good\nfaith” was incorporated in the 1963 proclamation was ambiguous as regards the\nscope of the duty. Article 26 of the law read as follows: “Each party engaged in\ncollective bargaining shall be required to recognize all of the other parties thereto\nand to negotiate with them in good faith.” The first impression from a close\nreading of the above provision is that once the parties voluntarily agree to engage\nin bargaining, they are expected and, in fact required, to bargain in good faith. Nevertheless, it was unclear as to whether there was in fact a duty to bargain in\nthe first place. This is because the law seemed to imply that it was only after\nengagement between the parties that the duty of good faith operates. It is thus\ndoubtful whether this provision had, indeed, imposed a duty on the parties to\nbargain. Furthermore, though the law had a long list of ‘unfair labour practices’\nfor both parties, failure to appear for bargaining was not among them. Hence, no\nsanction was attached to it in case of non-compliance with the duty. In reality, as indicated above, employers were rejecting requests for bargaining\nfrom trade unions with no legal consequences attached to the refusal. This\nambiguity in the scope of the duty was similar to that we observed in the\ninterpretations of international experience.",

    "text": "Even if interpreted in a manner to\nmean that there was a legal duty to bargain, the labour law did not provide any\nsanction if and when one of the parties failed to appear for bargaining nor did it\nprovide a time limit within which negotiations should commence. It thus\nremained as an empty promise with no enforcement mechanism in place. Another important collective bargaining issue which the 1963 Proclamation\nfailed to address was the issue of “disclosure.” The law was silent as to whether\neach party was duty bound to disclose relevant information to the other so that\n316\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nwell-informed and meaningful bargaining would be conducted. It may be argued\nthat the duty to negotiate in good faith should be interpreted to include the\nobligation to provide information at one’s disposal essential for the negotiation;\nand that withholding relevant information from the other negotiating party is a\nmanifestation of bad faith. Nevertheless, for the benefit of clarity, duties should\nhave been expressly stated so as not to provide room for doubt and debate. The\nILO seemed to realize such a lack of uniform interpretation in disclosure when it\ndrew up a Recommendation in 1981 recommending member states “to formulate\nmeasures adapted to national conditions (…) so that parties have access to the\ninformation required for meaningful negotiations.” It was indicated earlier that the implementing legislation for the establishment\nof trade unions was substantially delayed even after freedom of association was\nrecognized by the 1955 Revised Constitution. Even after the law on unionization\nwas adopted, the threshold membership to form a trade union was set at a high\nfigure, thereby limiting its use. In the context of collective bargaining also, rules\nand procedures lacked clarity as to the scope and nature of the parties’ duties. There was no express duty of disclosure nor was there a sanction against non-\ncompliance even if the duty was held to exist. It could thus be said that, during\nthe era of the Emperor, the laws on unionization and collective bargaining were\ntoo late in coming into force; and too ambiguous to implement. The introduction\nof the legal framework consequently appeared to be more of a public relations\nexercise than a serious political commitment to implement the rights. This\nconclusion is in line with Bahru’s view arguing about the lack of genuine political\nwill by the Imperial regime towards freedom of association. A very different picture was presented by the approach of the successor military\nregime.",

    "text": "The 1975 Labour Proclamation remedied some of the shortcomings in\nthe duty to bargain of the 1963 labour law. For instance, Proc. No.64/1975 made\n‘availability for collective bargaining’ one of the duties of the parties. The relevant\npart of the proclamation (Art.67 (2)) reads as follows: “the party to whom a\nrequest under sub-Article (1) [request for bargaining] has been made shall within\nfive days of receiving the request appear for collective negotiations”. With this\n317\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nstipulation in place, the parties were duty bound to make themselves available\nfor bargaining within five days of receiving the request. Thus, the issue of\nrecognition for bargaining purposes was no longer left to the voluntarism of the\nemployers. Consequently, the principle of “mandatory recognition” for collective\nbargaining purposes has been introduced in Ethiopian labour law ever since the\ncoming into effect of the Labour Proclamation of 1975. Unlike the labour law of the imperial era that did not provide any sanctions for\nnon-compliance with bargaining obligations, the 1975 Labour Proclamation\nprescribed a penalty. Thus, failure to appear for bargaining within five days was\nnot only a violation of a duty but also a punishable offence to the extent of\nimprisonment. There is, however, no record of any prosecution for non-\ncompliance with this duty ever resulting. It may be that as most enterprises\nduring the military regime were under state ownership, recognition of trade\nunions for bargaining purposes was not a serious problem. The 1975 Labour Proclamation also marked a clear change from the preceding\nposition on disclosure of information. The law expressly spelt out the duties\nimposed on the employer during and in connection with bargaining. It obligated\nthe employer with the responsibility of submitting all pertinent evidence and\ndocuments required during the negotiations at a pain of sanction. In employment\nrelationships, it is commonly the employer who possesses essential information\nsuch as financial reports of the enterprise and who may be reluctant to disclose\nthose to the other party. It can be argued that the absence of such information\nhandicaps the trade unions to develop well-informed and even possibly objective\nbargaining proposals. Disclosure helps in avoiding this kind of information gap. However, though there were favourable legal frameworks for collective\nbargaining during the military regime, measurable benefits from collective\nbargaining were less evident.",

Public savings have diminished as government current\nexpenditure, especially for defence and public administration, rose\nfaster than revenue. Meanwhile private saving and investment did not\nrespond adequately to various government initiatives. Thus, in practice, there was little or no benefit to be shared through collective\nbargaining. It can be argued that the mismatch between the apparently\nfavourable legal framework for collective bargaining on the one hand, and the\nadverse consequences of a restrictive and command economic policy of the time\non the other hand, did not bring any measurable gain to the labour force. The next political change in Ethiopia, the overthrow of the military regime, led\nagain in due course, in 1993, to a new labour proclamation, an instrument\nintended to reflect a change towards a more market-oriented economy. The\nProclamation brought with it a slightly different approach towards issues of\ncollective bargaining and collective agreements. Making oneself available for\nbargaining and bargaining in good faith were retained as express duties of the\nparties as was the provision of sanctions for non-compliance. Nevertheless, the\nsanction was now limited to a fine, with a maximum of Birr 1200 to be assessed\nby the First Instance Court labour division. Imprisonment as a possible sanction\nfor labour law violation was withdrawn, and the Criminal Bench was no longer\ninvolved in entertaining labour matters. Moreover, since then, the responsibility\nto prosecute labour law violations has been entrusted to the Labour Inspection\nService. However, the inspection service in Ethiopia has been understaffed, under-\nresourced and has lacked the necessary skill to prosecute violations. It has been\nreported that they have prosecuted only two cases in court in recent years. The\ninspection service complained that “officials from other ministries, such as the\nMinistry of Trade and Industry, become involved in cases pending in court\nasserting that the inspectors should withdraw charges [against violators] because\n319\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\npublic knowledge of alleged violations [prosecutions] may interfere with\ninvestment strategies.”",

    "text": "This shows the ambivalent position of the Government\nin the sense that the desire to enforce labour rights from the side of the inspection\noffice was in conflict with the desire to encourage investment even at the expense\nof labour rights as reflected by the position of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The other area where the post-military rule labour laws deviate from the labour\nlaw of the military regime is in the area of disclosure of information during\nbargaining. The duty of disclosure has been withdrawn from the list of duties\nspecifically imposed on employers. It might be argued that this is not a significant\ndeviation from the past in that even if the obligation to disclose information was\nnot expressly spelt out, such a duty may be inferred from the duty to negotiate in\ngood faith, and hence, the duty to disclose pertinent information remains intact. It may therefore be argued that an employer’s duty to bargain in good faith\nincludes the duty to equip the trade union representatives with adequate\ninformation to enable them understand and discuss the issues raised by the\nemployer so that effective collective bargaining can take place. The alternative and equally plausible argument is that the duty to disclose\ninformation to the other party does not exist under the existing legal framework\nfor the following reasons. First, legal duties should be expressly spelt out with a\nview to avoiding doubt and unnecessary controversy as to their existence. Second, in cases where the previous law expressly provided it as a duty, and the\nsubsequent law omitted it, a reasonable assumption would be that the duty no\nlonger exists because had the legislature intended to retain such a duty, it would\nhave spelt it out expressly as previously. Trade union leaders complain that private employers have been reluctant to\ndisclose particularly financial information of the enterprise to trade unions,\nalleging not only that it is a “business secret” which should not be divulged to\npersons other than the shareholders; but also that they no longer have the duty\nto disclose such information under the law. Nevertheless, the “business secret”\ndefence is less persuasive given that the Commercial Code of Ethiopia of 1960\n320\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nrequires business organisations to annually submit the balance sheet and profit\nand loss statements of the company to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\nfor publication in the Official Commercial Gazette. This legal duty on business\norganisations tends to suggest that the financial information is not a “business\nsecret.”",

    "text": "Rather, it is a public document that should be made public at the end of\nevery budget year. 7.2.6. Summary\nThe legal frameworks for collective bargaining in Ethiopia have undergone\nsignificant transformation overtime. Union “recognition” for collective\nbargaining purposes, moved from the ambivalent position of the 1963 Labour\nProclamation, to the “mandatory recognition” approach since the issuance of the\n1975 labour law. Thus, unlike the relevant ILO instruments which do not\nexpressly impose the duty to bargain on the parties, Ethiopian labour laws have\nsince 1975 explicitly provided for the duty to bargain and to bargain in good faith\nat the pain of sanctions. It may be safe to conclude that since the laws do not\nimpose the duty to reach at an agreement on the negotiating parties, imposing a\nduty to bargain on the parties is consistent with the intent and purpose of\nConvention No.98 which is promoting effective collective bargaining. In terms of subject matter eligible for collective bargaining, the international\nexperience has shown the tendency of expanding the subject matter on the\nbargaining table from purely economic issues to social and managerial issues. Similarly, the Ethiopian successive labour legislation gradually but steadily\nbroadened the scope from purely economic matters of “bread and butter” issues,\ninto, among other things, the territory of the managerial prerogatives and skill\ndevelopment issues. Consequently, as far as the letter of the law is concerned,\neconomic, social and managerial issues have been opened up for collective\nbargaining. However, development in the legal rules do not necessarily tell us\nanything about the practical impact of those rules and what obstacles, if any,\nthere are to their implementation and effectiveness. 321\nFreedom of Association in Employment in Ethiopia\nNotwithstanding these positive legal developments, there are also appreciable\nreversals militating against effective collective bargaining, which were\nintroduced side by side with the introduction of the market oriented economic\npolicy. For instance, it was noted above that with the coming into power of the\npost-military rule and the adoption of a new labour law, the express duty of\ndisclosure has been removed from the law. It may be that with the change to a\nmore investment-friendly economic policy, the post-1991 government might\nhave considered that maintaining employers’ duty of disclosure would be an\nundue regulatory burden to business and therefore inconsistent with the\ngovernment’s market oriented economic policy.",

    "text": "However, the effect is to shift\nthe legal balance in a manner that is at the expense of equally important\ncommitment of promoting effective collective bargaining which is limited unless\nthere is disclosure of relevant information. It was indicated in the preceding\nchapters that trade unions in Ethiopia proved to be weak in terms of\norganisational strength and experience and these limitations require and justify\nfacilitative state measures such as imposing the duty of disclosure if collective\nbargaining is to be meaningful and effective. A further reversal concerns the pre-2003 provision that in order to ensure\ncontinuity of stipulated terms and conditions of employment collective\nagreements was to remain in force until replaced by new collective agreements. The labour law of 2003 stipulated for the withdrawal of the binding force of\nemployment conditions established by a collective agreement even when re-\nnegotiation to replace it is not yet finalized which tends to affect the status quo\nin collective labour relations. In fact, Compa (2006) documented a similarly\nflexible approach in labour law reforms of other jurisdictions which were covered\nby his report. The other area of concern is that although the labour inspection service has been\nentrusted with wider powers of supervision and prosecutorial responsibilities\nagainst labour standard violations including violation of the duty to bargain in\ngood faith, the inspection service is organised in such a manner that it is ill-\nequipped and understaffed to efficiently discharge its responsibilities. Even when\n322\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nit attempts to take prosecutorial actions within its mandate, pro-investment\nagencies such as the Ministry of Trade and Industry have tended to undermine\nthe monitoring activities of the labour inspection service. The contention is that\nthat such supervision may discourage investors and investment. Thus, the\ntendency has been that either the laws are being formulated in investment-\nfriendly manner or the protective laws may be left intact but with their\nimplementation neutralized by executive measures, thereby making them merely\n“tiger papers.” The literature on the current challenges on trade unionism has\nrecorded that there have been tendencies to withdraw protective labour laws or\nto deliberately ignore their enforcement on the belief that investment may be\nattracted and retained by so doing. ******************************************\n323\nChapter VIII\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\n8.1.

    "text": "It must be noted that no matter how clear and\nwell-articulated provisions of a law may be, there will always be disputes in their\ninterpretation and application. Of course clear and well-articulated provisions\nmay reduce the occurrence of such disputes. But they may not prevent or avoid\nthe occurrence of disputes altogether. Hence, there is a need to lay down in\nadvance dispute settlement mechanisms so that disputes could be managed and\nresolved accordingly if and when they arise. Since the employment relation is a unique contractual relationship, it requires a\nunique dispute resolution arrangement. In many cases it is within the continuity\nof relationship framework that disputes may occur; and hence they need to be\nresolved in a manner that would not adversely affect the continuous relationship\nbetween them. Dispute settlement within the labour law regime differs from that\nof the civil service. The former is mainly a dispute of private nature, while the\nlatter is a public one. Generally, the Regular courts and Labour Relations Boards\nare the most important dispute settling organs for labour law purposes. As regards\nto the civil service employment regime, disciplinary committees, administrative\ntribunals and regular courts have jurisdiction to entertain Civil Service\nemployment disputes. We will discuss the labour law regime first, after which\nbrief discussion for the civil service will follow. 8.2. Nature of Labour Disputes and Jurisdiction\nFrom the preceding chapters, we will recall that employment relation manifests\nitself either in individual or collective features. The nature of the disputes may\nbe reflections of such interactions in the sense that there will be individual and\n324\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\ncollective employment disputes as well. However, as freedom of association is not\nyet recognized for the civil service employment regime in Ethiopia, we do not\nhave disputes of collective nature for that employment regime. Under the labour law, other than conciliation and arbitration efforts, whether a\ndispute is under the jurisdiction of a regular court or a labour relations board\ndepends on the nature of dispute. Admittedly under the Civil Code era there was\nno distinction between individual and collective labour relations. Since there was\nno freedom of association then, all labour relations at the time were individual,\nand hence the disputes were individual as well. Thus it was the regular civil court\nthat had the jurisdiction to entertain labour disputes. It was with the coming in to effect of the Labour Relations’ Proclamation\nNo.210/1963 that individual and collective labour relations were brought into\nexistence.",

    "text": "In fact, it was also through the promulgation of that law for the first\ntime Labour Relations Board was introduced to the Ethiopian employment\ndispute resolution system. Emanating from these relations, individual and\ncollective disputes began to crop up. In terms of competence, individual labour disputes are within the jurisdiction of\nregular courts (labour division) while the collective labour disputes are under the\ncompetence of the Labour Relations Board. Therefore, determining whether a\ncertain dispute is individual or collective is essential in deciding which organ has\ncompetence to entertain the case. But how individual labour dispute is to be\ndistinguished from the collective one is a crucial issue to be resolved. With this purpose in view, Proclamation No.64/1975 defined “individual trade\ndispute” and “collective trade dispute.” Accordingly, “Individual Trade Dispute”\nmeans a claim of an aggrieved worker arising out of the violation or alteration of\nprovisions contained in laws, regulations, work rules or individual contracts of\nemployment or the non-application of established practices by the undertaking\n(Article 2(12). Conversely “Collective Trade Dispute” means any claim arising out\nof the interpretation or the improvement of existing provisions or benefits\n325\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\ncontained in laws or regulations or collective agreements or work rules or\naccepted practices and any dispute involving questions or representation by the\nworkers or the undertaking or arising in the course of collective negotiations\n(Article 2(5). However, since the adoption of Labour Proclamation No.42/1993, the legislature,\ninstead of defining these concepts, resorted to spelling out illustrative listing so\nthat similar issues could be included. The lists for each of them have been\nreproduced herein below. Article 139: Labour Division of First Instance Court\n1) The labour division of a federal and regional first instance court shall have\njurisdiction to settle and determine the following and other similar\nindividual labour disputes (underline added);\na) Disciplinary measures including dismissal;\nb) Claims related to the termination of employment contracts;\nc) Claims related to hours of work, remuneration, leaves and rest day;\nd) Claims related to the issuance of certificate of service and clearance;\ne) Claims pertaining to employment injury, transfer, promotion,\ntraining and other similar issues;\nf) Unless otherwise provided in this Proclamation, suits pertaining to\nviolations of provisions of this Proclamation.",

In fact, due to lack of sufficient clarity with this\nillustrative approach, the issue proved to be one of the most controversial in\npractice. As a result, the Federal Supreme Court Cassation Division was\ncompelled to formulate a binding interpretation on this subject. The core of the Cassation Division’s interpretative note is “if the dispute revolves\naround individual claims or concerns individually or even collectively, it is\nindividual labour dispute while if the resolution of the dispute will have the effect\nof affecting all or substantial part of the labour force, the dispute will be\ncategorized as a collective one” (KK Textile Industry v. KK Basic Trade Union;\nFile No.18180: Vol. I). 8.3. Organizational Composition and Working Systems\nIt must be clear from the outset that, though legislating labour law is within the\ncompetence of the federal legislature, its dispute settlement mechanism is partly\nentrusted to the regional states. In individual labour disputes, it is only in cases\narising in Addis Ababa or Dire Dawa that the Federal First Instance Court Labour\n327\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nDivision would be involved. In all other cases, the first instance regional court\nlabour divisions where the dispute arises have jurisdiction. Appeal from these\nfora is to be referred to the regional appellate courts except in Addis Ababa and\nDire Dawa from which appeal is lodged to the Federal High Court.",

    "text": "Therefore, it\nmay be argued that, the principal competence for individual labour disputes falls\nunder the regional courts. A point to note is, Addis Ababa is the capital city of Ethiopia and at the same time\na regional capital for Oromia Regional State. Due to this overlapping,\ndetermination of jurisdiction for labour disputes arising within Oromia state\nowned enterprises situated in Addis Ababa was an issue. Whether it is to be\nsubmitted to the Federal First Instance Court or to Oromia Region first instance\ncourt an unsettled issue. However, in Teklie Haile et al v. Oromia Road\nConstruction Enterprise; File No.100950/2007 E.C. (unpublished) case, the\nCassation Division ruled that it is the Oromia regional first instance court rather\nthan the Federal First Instance Court which, has jurisdiction to entertain\nindividual labour dispute cases where the defendant is Oromia state owned\nenterprises situated in Addis Ababa. Oromia Region has a zonal administrative\nstructure named as “Finfinie Special Zone” where it has also established a first\ninstance courts within the environs of Addis Ababa (Finfinie). The Cassation Division’s ruling on the case at hand was initiated by the Cassation\nDivision on its own motion. The defendants did not challenge the material\njurisdiction of the federal courts; nor did the lower courts raised the issue. They\ntook it for granted that they possess the material jurisdiction over the case. Admittedly, the issue of material jurisdiction can be invoked by the courts at any\nlevel even if it is not raised by the parties to the dispute. Therefore, the Cassation\nDivision is authorized to invoke it. The issue however is, should federal courts be denied material jurisdiction due to\nthe fact that one of the parties to the dispute is regional state-owned business\nentity? It seems to me that any business entity, regardless of the type of\nownership, is a private person. In practice state enterprises own by the federal\n328\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\ngovernment have been summoned to appear before regional first instance court\nof labour divisions where they operate branch offices.

Due to\nthis I am of the view that the holding of the Cassation Division on the case at\nhand is liable to doubt and debate. In fact, in another case (East Cement Share\nCompany v. Zelalem Tadesse; File No.95638: Vol.17), the Cassation Division held\na slightly different position in the sense that it ruled that in labour disputes the\nidentity of the disputants would not be taken in to account in determining\njurisdiction of federal and regional courts. Problem for discussion:\nPlease closely read the above cited two cassation cases and decide among\nyourselves whether the Cassation Division was consistent in its ruling on\nthe issue. Interestingly, the record shows that both cases were decided in the same\nyear (2007 E.C.)\nAs regards to collective labour disputes, the law anticipates the Labour Relation\nBoards are to be established at federal and regional levels.

The Labour Relations Boards established in the\nregions entertain collective labour disputes arising in their respective regions. Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa administrations have labour relations boards as well\nwith similar competence. Appeal from the various labour relations boards is to be submitted to the Federal\nHigh Court or pursuant to the delegation provided given by the Federal\nConstitution to the Regional Supreme Court. Hence, it seems safe to conclude\nthat the core competence for collective labour disputes rests on the federal\nadjudicative forum. The Labour Relations Boards are considered to be more\nknowledgeable than the courts in factual issues of industrial relations. As a result,\nfactual determinations by the boards are conclusive. Nevertheless, it is important\nto note that, more often than not, delineation of issues of fact and law is difficult,\nif not impossible. Be these as it may, the composition and the working systems of the regular court\nlabour divisions and the Labour Relations Boards are significantly different. As\nregards to composition, the labour divisions of the regular courts are to be\noperated by sitting judges of the ordinary courts.",

If so, why should the Regional Court Cassation\nDivision be empowered to examine fundamental error of a federal law? Do you agree with the holding of the Federal Supreme Court Cassation\nDivision in this regard? The other modality of employment dispute settlement pertaining to the labour\nlaw employment regime is strike or lock-down. Strike is an industrial action\navailable for the labour force; while lock-out is to be exercised by an employer\nwith a similar object and purpose in view. These are essentially self-help\nmeasures where the initiating party may withhold its contractual commitments\nin order to compel the other party to accept its demands. However, since such a\nunilateral measure is technically a breach of contract, it cannot be allowed to be\nundertaken at the pleasure of the initiating party. In fact, it must be a measure of\nlast resort in the sense that it is after all other lawful avenues to resolve the\ndispute are exhausted that this self-help measure may be exercised. 333\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nMore importantly, this right to industrial action is not available to all sectors of\nthe economy. There are enterprises which are not allowed to undertake strike or\nlock-down.",

The Committee on\nFreedom of Association of the ILO is of the view that where the right to strike is\nrestricted or prohibited in certain essential undertakings or services, adequate\nprotection should be given to the workers to compensate for the limitation\nthereby placed on their freedom of action with regard to disputes affecting such\nundertakings and services. As regards the nature of appropriate guarantees, it is stated that, in cases where\nrestrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services, restrictions on\nthe right to strike should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy\nconciliation and arbitration proceedings in which the parties concerned can take\npart at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly\nimplemented.

    "text": "The Labour Proclamation has\nestablished these two boards with similar composition having their own distinct\nobjectives to attain. The permanent Labour Relations Board, as it name implies,\n337\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nis permanently there to entertain, amicably settle and render decisions on\ncollective labour disputes submitted to it, except on “determination of issues of\nwage and other benefits” (Article 148 (1). This implies Permanent Board has no\npower to determine issues of wage and other benefits because it is considered that\nsuch cases should not be judicially determined. It is believed that judges are not\nexperts in determining bonuses and wage increments. These issues are more of\neconomic and managerial items. It has been considered appropriate that\nenterprises other than those rendering essential services, whenever they\nencounter disputes pertaining determination of wages and other benefits, should\ncompel their employers to accept their terms through strike. The ad-hoc Labour Relations Board, for its part, is a temporary forum to be\nestablished for a specific purpose. This ad-hoc board is empowered to entertain\nissues pertaining to wages and other benefits with regard to enterprises rendering\nessential services (Article 148(2). Essential services (Article 137(2) are meant\nthose “services whose interruption would endanger the life, personal safety or\nhealth of the whole or part of the population.” As a result, they are denied from\ncalling of strike or lock-out. In principle ILO is not against national laws\nprohibiting strike or lock-out in enterprises rendering essentials service, provided\nthat they are narrowly defined and compensatory guarantee is offered. Therefore,\nit is with a view to providing them with compensatory guarantee that an Ad-hoc\nLabour Relations Board has been established in order to render decision on wage\nand other benefit in these enterprises. To sum up, as far as the legal formulation is concerned, disputes pertaining to\nwages and other benefits is not to be determined by decision of the Labour\nRelations Board because such issues have economic implication to which judicial\nfor a have no adequate knowledge. If at all dispute arises on those issues, it should\nbe through industrial action (i.e. strike or lock-out) that one of the parties would\ncompel the other to accept its terms. That is why the permanent Labour Relations\nBoard is denied from entertaining such disputes.",

At this time in point there is an issue that deserve further clarification. As indicated \nabove, permanent labour relations boards have been prohibited from rendering\ndecisions on determination of wages and other benefits. The issue, however, is what\ndoes “determination of wages and other benefits” mean? In Construction works and\nCoffee Technology Promotion Enterprise-Trade Union v. Construction works and\nCoffee Technology Promotion Enterprise; File No. 49152: Vol.10 case, the trade\nunion and the enterprise negotiated and signed a collective agreement which was \nduly registered. The collective agreement in question had provisions on the\nconditions as to when and what amount of bonuses shall be given to the employees. An attainment of a certain profit threshold in a budget year was set for bonuses to be\npayable to the labour force. The trade union claimed that the enterprise registered a\ngross profit of 78,000,000 (seventy eight million) in the 2000 budget year and hence\none month salary increment and half month salary in the form of bonus should be \nawarded to the labour force as per Article 24(1) of the collective agreement. The case\nwas submitted to Federal First Instance Court Labour Division for contract\nenforcement. The enterprise filed preliminary objection arguing that since the case\nis a collective labour dispute, the court has no jurisdiction to entertain it. The court\naccepted the contention of the defendant and closed the file. The trade union brought fresh case to the Labour Relations Board for the\nenforcement of the provision of the collective agreement. The Board dismissed the\ncase ruling that it has no jurisdiction in determining wages and other benefits. Although the case was referred to the Federal High Court on appeal, the Court\naffirmed the board’s decision. Finally, the trade union submitted an application for\ncassation contending that the lower tribunal committed fundamental error of law. However, the Cassation Division upheld the decisions of the lower labour\ntribunals. The Cassation Division reasoned that the terms of a collective agreement pertaining\nto “wage and other benefits” cannot be enforced before labour tribunals.",

    "text": "According\nto the Cassation Division, it is rather for the party claiming the benefit (the trade\n339\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nunion in the present case) to take industrial action in order to put pressure on the\nother party to comply with the terms of the collective agreement. It proposed that\ncalling on a strike is the appropriate measure to resolve disputes pertaining to wages\nand other benefits prescribed in a collective agreement. It did not view the terms of\na collective agreement on wages and other benefits as judicially enforceable\nprovisions. With due respect to the Cassation Division’s ruling, I am of the view that \nthis is not the intention of the legislature. It must be noted that Ethiopian labour law requires a collective agreement be made\nin writing and signed by the parties. Moreover, it needs to be registered before a\ngovernmental organ. Once these formalities are satisfied, it is expressly stated that it\nbegins to produce legal effect from the date of signature (Article 134(2). It is on the \nface of these rigorous procedures and clear legal stipulation that the Cassation\nDivision denied enforcement of its terms. In my view, the legislature would not have prescribed this rigorous procedure for\nvalidity of a collective agreement had the position been that it would be enforced\nthrough private action. In fact, it could be said that one of the objectives of effective\ncollective bargaining is to prevent or minimize the occurrence and frequency of \nindustrial actions. Interestingly, the Cassation Division did not rule that a collective\nagreement in its entirety is not enforceable before labour tribunals. It is only for the\nterms of a collective agreement relating to wage and other benefits that it denied\njudicial enforcement. Of course, if the terms of the collective agreement were not\nsufficiently clear, it may be appropriate to deny enforcement until the bargaining\nparties come up with clear and enforceable terms. Otherwise, if it has sufficient \nclarity, it would be going contrary to the intention of the parties to enforce some of\ntheir terms and deny enforcement to other terms within the same instrument. In my view, what the Permanent Labour Relations Board has been prohibited   is\ndetermination of wages and other benefits. Determination is meant fixing the\namount of wages and the benefits payable to the employees. However, in the case\nat hand, the parties have already fixed when and what benefit is to be paid. The\nBoard was merely requested to enforce what has already been determined by the\nparties.",

However, the absence of explicit ILO standards\nshould not lead to the conclusion that the Organizations disregards the right to\nstrike or abstains from providing a protective framework within which it may be\nexercised. Two resolutions of the International Labour Conference itself –which provide\nguidelines for ILO policy –in one way or another emphasized recognition of the\nright to strike in members States. The “Resolution concerning the Abolition of\nAnti- Trade Union Legislation in the States members of the International Labour\nOrganization” adopted in 1957, called for the adoption of “laws… ensuring the\neffective and unrestricted exercise of trade union rights, including the right to\nstrike by the workers. Similarly, the “Resolution concerning Trade Union Rights\nand Their Relation to Civil Liberties”, adopted in 1970, invited the Governing\n341\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nBody to instruct the Director General to take action in a number of ways “with a\nview to considering further action to ensure full and universal respect for trade\nunion rights in their broadest sense”, with particular attention to be paid, inter\nalia, to the “right to strike”.

Over the years, in line with this principle, the\nCommittee on Freedom of Association has recognized that strike action is a right\nand not simply a social act, and has also:\n1. made it clear it is a right which workers and their organizations (trade\nunions, federations and confederations) are entitled to enjoy;\n2. reduced the number of categories of workers who may be deprived of\nthis right, as well as the legal restrictions on its exercise, which should not\nbe excessive;\n3. linked the exercise of the right to strike to the objective of promoting and\ndefending the economic and social interests of workers (which criterion\nexcludes strikes of a purely political nature from the scope of international\n344\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nprotection provided by the ILO, although the Committee makes no direct\nstatement or indication regarding sympathy strikes other than that they\ncannot be banned outright; this matter will be examined subsequently);\n4. stated that the legitimate exercise of the strike should not entail\nprejudicial penalties of any sort, which would imply acts of anti- union\ndiscrimination.

This is more\ndifficult to determine when there is no work stoppage as such but a\nslowdown in work (go-slow strike) or when work rules are applied to\nthe letter (work-to-rule); these forms of strike action are often just as\nparalyzing as a total stoppage. Noting that national law and practice\nvary widely in this respect, the Committee is of the opinion that\nrestrictions as to the forms of strike action can only be justified if the\naction ceases to be peaceful. 345\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nThe Committee considers …that restrictions on strike pickets and\nworkplace occupations should be limited to cases where the action\nceases to be peaceful. Objectives of strikes\nThis section examines the nature of claims pursued through strike action which\nare covered by the body of principles set down by the Committee on Freedom of\nAssociation and the Committee of Experts. In discussing this matter, reference\nshould be made at the outset to Article 10 of Convention No. 87 which, for the\npurposes of the Convention, defines worker organizations as any organization\nestablished “for furthering and defending the interests of workers”. This\ndefinition is clearly of fundamental importance not only in that it sets down\nguidelines for differentiating such organizations is for those other types, but also\nbecause it specifies the purpose of such organizations for “furthering and\ndefending the interests of workers” thereby demarcating the boundaries within\nwhich the rights and guarantees recognized by the convention are applicable, and\nconsequently protected in so far as they achieve or seek to achieve the stated\nobjectives. The nature of the demands pursued through strike action may be categorized as\nbeing occupational (seeking to guarantee or improve workers’ working or living\nconditions), trade union (seeking to guarantee or develop the rights of trade\nunion organization and their leaders), or political. The two former categories do\nnot give rise to any particular problems as from the outset the Committee on\nFreedom of Association has made clear decisions stating that they are legitimate. However, within the three categories of demand specified, a distinction should\nbe made as to whether or not they directly and immediately affect the workers\nwho call the strike. It should at once be noted that the Committee on Freedom\nof Association and the Committee of Experts have rejected the notion that the\nright to strike should be confined to industrial disputes that are likely to be\nresolved through the signing of a collective agreement.",

    "text": "346\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nPolitical strikes\nOn the basis of the definition of “workers’ organization” contained in Article 10\nof Convention No. 87, the Committee on Freedom of Association considers that\n“strikes of a purely political nature… do not fall within the scope of the principles\nof freedom of association. However, although the Committee has expressly stated that “it is only in so far as\ntrade union organizations do not allow their occupational demands to assume a\npurely political aspect that they can legitimately claim that there should be no\ninterference in their activities”, it has also specified that it is difficult to draw a\nclear distinction between what is political and what is, properly speaking, trade\nunion in character, and that these two notions overlap. Hence, in a subsequent decision, the Committee concluded that the occupational\nand economic interests which workers defend through the exercise of the right\nto strike do not only concern better working conditions or collective claims of an\noccupational nature, but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social\npolicy questions. Along the same lines, the Committee has stated that the workers\nand their organizations should be able to express their dissatisfaction regarding\neconomic and social matters affecting workers’ interests in circumstances that\nextend beyond the industrial disputes that are likely to be resolved through the\nsigning of a collective agreement. Nevertheless, workers action should consist\nmerely in the expression of a protest and not be intended as a breach of peace. In\nthis connection, the Committee on Freedom of Association has stated that “a\ndeclaration of the illegality of a national strike protesting against the social and\nlabour consequences of the government’s economic policy and the banning of the\nstrike constitute a serious violation of freedom of association”. That said, it should\nbe added that the principles laid down cover both strikes at the local level, and\ngeneral strikes, which by their nature have markedly political connotation.",

    "text": "As\nregard the geographical scope of the strike:\n347\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nThe Committee [on freedom of association] has stated on many occasions that\nstrikes at the national level are legitimate in so far as they have economic and\nsocial objectives and not purely political ones; the prohibition of strikes could\nonly be acceptable in the case of public servants exercising authority in the name\nof the State or of workers in essential services in the strict sense of the term, i.e.\nservices whose interruption could endanger the life, personal safety or health of\nthe whole or part of the population (ILO, 1996d,para. 492). As regards the general strike, in its examination of one particular case, the\nCommittee considered that “[a] 24- hour general strike seeking an increasing in\nthe minimum wage, respect of collective agreements in force and a change in\neconomic policy (to decrease prices and unemployment) is legitimate and within\nthe normal field of activity of trade union organizations”. Similarly, in\nconnection with another case, the Committee concluded that “[a] general protest\nstrike demanding that an end be put to the hundreds of murders of trade union\nleaders and unionists during the past few years is a legitimate trade union activity\nand its prohibition therefore constitutes a serious violation of freedom of\nassociation”. The Committee on Freedom of Association’s attitude in cases where the demands\npursed through strike action include some of an occupational or trade union\nnature and others of a political nature has been to recognize the legitimate of the\nstrike when the occupational or trade union demands expressed did not seem\nmerely a pretext disguising purely political objectives unconnected with the\npromotion and defence of workers’ interests. The Committee of Experts also has stated that strikes that are purely political in\ncharacter do not fall within the scope of freedom of association. However, the\ndifficulty arises from the fact that it is often impossible to distinguish in practice\nbetween the political and occupational aspects of a strike, since a policy adopted\nby a government frequently has immediate repercussions for workers or\nemployers; this is the case, for example, of a general wage and price freeze.",

    "text": "348\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIn the view of the Committee, organizations responsible for defending workers’\nsocio-economic and occupational interests should, in principle, be able to use\nstrike action to support their position in the search for solutions posed by major\nsocial and economic policy trends which have a direct impact on their members\nand on workers in general, in particular as regards employment, social protection\nand the standard of living. Sympathy Strikes\nWhere sympathy strikes are concerned, the crux of the issue is to decide whether\nworkers may declare a strike for occupational, trade union or social and economic\nmotives which do not affect them in a direct and immediate manner. In its General Survey of 1983, the Committee of Experts defined sympathy strikes\n(“where workers come out in support of another strike”) and determined that a\ngeneral prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers\nshould be able to take such action provided that the initial strike they are\nsupporting is itself lawful. This principle was then taken up in 1987 by the\nCommittee on Freedom of Association when it examined a decree which did not\nban sympathy strikes but merely regulated them by limiting the possibilities of\nrecourse to this type of action. In the Committee’s opinion, although several\nprovisions contained in the decree might be justified by the need to respect\nvarious procedures (notification of the strike to the labour authorities) or to\nguarantee security within the undertaking (the prevision of agitators and strike-\nbreakers from entering the workplace) others, however, such as geographical or\nsectoral restrictions placed on sympathy strikes –which therefore exclude general\nstrikes of this nature –or restrictions on their duration and frequently, constitute\na serious obstacle to the calling of such strikes. Similarly, the Committee of Experts has subsequently stated that:\nSympathy strikes, which are recognized as lawful in some countries, are\nbecoming increasingly frequent because of the move towards the\n349\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nconcentration of enterprises, the globalization of the economy and the\ndelocalization of work centres. While pointing out that a number of\ndistinction need to be drawn here (such as an exact definition of the\nconcept of a sympathy strikes; a relationship justifying recourse to this\ntype of strike etc.), the Committee considers that a general prohibition\non sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able\nto take such action, provided the initial strike they are supporting is\nitself lawful.",

As a result, the Committee on Freedom of Association has refused\nto find an objection to legislations which deny the right to strike to such groups\nof workers.

    "text": "That being said, it should be emphasized that on the question of the right to strike\nin the public service, the ILO’s supervisory bodies’ approach is based on the fact\nthat the concept of public servant varies considerably from one country to\nanother. It may be deduced from the statements of the Committee of Experts and\nof the Committee on Freedom of Association that the concept of the public\nservants, where their possible exclusion from the right to strike is concerned,\nrelates to public servants who exercise authority in the name of the state. The\nimplications of this approach are important in that the guidelines for determining\nthose public servants who may be excluded no longer emanates from the\napplication to them of the national law governing the public service, but from\nthe nature of the functions that such public servants carry out. Thus, while the\nright to strike of officials in the employ of ministers and other comparable\ngovernment bodies, as well as that of their assistants and of officials working in\nthe administration of justice and staff in the judiciary, may be subject to major\nrestrictions or even prohibition, the same does not apply, for instance, to persons\nemployed by the state enterprise. To date, in response to complaints submitted to\nit, the Committee on Freedom of Association has stated that certain categories of\npublic servants do not exercise authority in the name at the state, such as public\nservants in state owned commercial or industrial enterprise, in oil, banking and\nmetropolitan transport undertakings or those employed in the education sector\nand, more generally, those who work in the state companies and enterprises. 351\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nFinally, it should be noted that, among the categories of public servants who do\nnot exercise authority in the name of the state, those who carry out an essential\nservice in the strict sense of the term may be excluded from having recourse to\nstrike action. This concept will be examined in the following paragraphs. The Committee of Experts shares the principles of the Committee on Freedom of\nAssociation regarding situations in which the right to strike is severely restricted\nor even prohibited. In this connection, the Committee of Experts has observed\nthat “a too broad definition of the concept of public servant is likely to result in\na very wide restriction or even a prohibition of the right to strike for these\nworkers”. The Committee has pointed out that one of the main difficulties is due\nto the fact that the concept itself varies considerably from one legal system to\nanother.",

The Committee has considered that although it cannot overlook the special\ncharacteristics and legal and social traditions of each country, it must endeavour\nto establish fairly uniform criteria in order to examine the compatibility of\nlegislation with the provisions of Convention No. 87.

This definition was\nadopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association shortly afterwards. Clearly, what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term\n“depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a\ncountry”; likewise, there can be no doubt that “a non-essential service may\nbecome essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain\nscope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of whole or part of the\npopulation”.",

They may range from merely a relatively short limitative\nenumeration to a long list which is included in the law itself. Sometimes\nthe law includes definitions, from the most restrictive to the most\ngeneral kind, covering all activities which the government may\nconsider appropriate to include all strikes which it deems detrimental\nto public order, the general interest or economic development. In\nextreme cases, the legislation provides that a mere statement to this\neffect by the authorities suffices to justify the essential nature of the\nservice.

A strike\nin the port or maritime transport services, for example, might more\nrapidly cause serious disruptions for an island which is heavily\ndependent on such services to provide basic supplies to its population\nthan it would for the country on a continent. Furthermore, a non-\nessential service in the strict sense of the term may become essential if\n355\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nthe strike affecting it exceeds a certain duration or extent so that the\nlife, personal safety or health of the population are endangering (for\nexample, in household refuse collection services).",

The Committee on Freedom of\nassociation has specified that such conditions “should be reasonable and in any\nevent not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to\ntrade union organizations”. The large number of Committee decisions in this\nconnection may be attributed to the fact that some 15 percent of the cases\nsubmitted to it concern the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee on Freedom of Association has accepted the following\nprerequisites:\n1. the obligation to give prior notice;\n358\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n2. the obligation to have recourse to conciliation, mediation and (voluntary)\narbitration procedures in industrial disputes as a prior condition to\ndeclaring a strike, provided that the proceedings are adequate, impartial\nand speedy and that the parties concerned can take part at every stage;\n3. the obligation to observe a certain quorum and to obtain the agreement\nof a specified majority;\n4. the obligation to take strike decisions by secret ballot;\n5. the adoption of measures to comply with safety requirements and for the\nprevention of accidents;\n6. the establishment of a minimum service in particular cases; and\n7. the guarantee of freedom to work for non-strikers.

Secondly, since the Committee’s principles are couched in general terms, they\nare applicable at all stages of a dispute. In other words, legislation cannot impose compulsory binding arbitration as a\nreplacement for strike action, either at the outset or during the course of an\nindustrial dispute, except in the case of an essential service, or when a non-\nessential service is interrupted for so long that it endangers the life, safety or\nhealth of the whole or part of the population (and that the non-essential service\nthereby becomes essential), or- as recently pointed out by the Committee,\ninvoking the view of the Committee of Experts- when, after protracted and\nfruitless negotiations, it is obvious that the deadlock in bargaining will not be\nbroken without some initiative on the part of the authority. The Committee of Experts has stated that some confusion arises at times as to the\nexact meaning of the term “compulsory arbitration”. If that term refers to the\ncompulsory effects of an arbitration procedure resorted to voluntarily by both\nparties, this does not raise difficulties in the Committee’s opinion since parties\nshould normally be deemed to accept to be bound by the decision the arbitrator\nor arbitration board they have freely chosen. The real issue arises in practice in\nthe case of compulsory arbitration which authorities may impose in an interest\ndispute at the request of one party, or at their initiative. As regards arbitration imposed by the authorities at the request of one party, the\nCommittee considers that it is generally contrary to the principle of the voluntary\nnegotiation of collective agreements established in Convention No. 98, and thus\nthe autonomy of bargaining partners. An exception might, however, be made in\nthe case of provisions which, for instance, allow workers’ organizations to initiate\nsuch a procedure on their own, for the conclusion of a first collective agreement. 361\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nAs experience shows that first collective agreements is often one of the most\ndifficult steps in establishing a sound bargaining relationship, these types of\nprovisions may be said to be in the spirit of machinery and procedures which\nfacilitate collective bargaining.",

However, it has to recognize that there comes a time in\nbargaining where, after protracted and fruitless negotiations, the authorities\nmight be justified to step in when it is obvious that the deadlock in bargaining\nwill not be broken without some initiative on their part. In view of the wide\nvariety of legal frameworks (completed through national case law and practice)\nestablished in the various member states to address what constitutes one of the\nmost difficult problems of industrial relations, the Committee would only give\nsome general guidance in this respect and suggest a few principles that could be\nimplemented through “measures adapted to national conditions”, as\ncontemplated in Article 4 of the Convention. In the Committee’s opinion, it would be highly advisable that the parties be given\nevery opportunity to bargain collectively, during a sufficient period with the help\nof independent facilitators (mediator, conciliator, etc.) and machinery and\nprocedures designed with the foremost objective of facilitating collective\nbargaining. Based on the premise that a negotiated agreement, however\nunsatisfactory, is to be preferred to an imposed solution, the parties should always\nretain the option of returning voluntarily to the bargaining table, which implies\nthat whatever disputes settlement mechanism is adopted should incorporate the\npossibility of suspending the compulsory arbitration process, if the parties want\nto resume negotiations. 362\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nQuorum and majority for declaring strikes\nRegarding the quorum and requisite majority for taking strike decisions, the\nCommittee on Freedom of Association has adopted criteria in response to the\ncomplaints submitted to it: it has indicated, for example, that the observance of\n“a quorum of two- thirds of the members may be difficult to reach, in particular\nwhere trade unions have large numbers of members covering a large area”.

Obviously, these principles were formulated in connection with\nspecific legislation and are mentioned here by the way of example, without\ndetriment to the legitimacy of other systems of the quorum and majority. More recent decisions by the Committee reflect a more general approach:\nThe requirement of a decision by over half of all the workers involved in order\nto declare a strike is excessive and could excessively hinder the possibilities of\ncarrying out a strike, particularly in large enterprises. The requirement that an absolute majority of workers should be obtained for the\ncalling of a strike may be difficult, especially in the case of unions which group\ntogether a large number of members. A provision requiring an absolute majority\nmay, therefore, involve the risk of seriously limiting the right to strike. 363\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nThe Committee of Experts has confirmed that:\nIn many countries legislation subordinates the exercise of the right to\nstrike to prior approval by a certain percentage of workers. Although\nthis requirement does not, in principle, raise problems of compatibility\nwith the Convention, the ballot method, the quorum and the majority\nrequired should not be such that the exercise of the right to strike\nbecomes very difficult, or even impossible in practice. The conditions\nestablished in the legislation of different countries vary considerably\nand their compatibility with the Convention may also depend on\nfactual element such as the scattering or geographical isolation of work\ncentres or the structure of collective bargaining (by enterprise or\nindustry), all of which require an examination on a case-by-case basis. If a member state deems it appropriate to establish in its legislation\nprovisions which require a vote by workers before a strike can be held,\nit should ensure that account is taken only of the votes cast, and that\nthe required quorum and majority are fixed at a reasonable level.",

The Committee has pointed out that it is important for provisions\nregarding the minimum service to be maintained… to be established clearly to\nbe applied strictly and made known to those concerned in due time. In the event of a strike in public services, if there is any disagreement between\nthe parties as to the number and duties of the workers concerned in a minimum\nservice, the Committee is of the opinion that “the legislation should provide for\n365\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nany such disagreement to be settled by an independent body and not by the\nministry of labour, or the ministry of public enterprises concerned”.

Likewise, the Committee on Freedom of Association\nhas stated that “a ban on strike action not linked to a collective dispute to which\nthe employee or union is party is contrary to the principals of freedom of\nassociation”.

    "text": "On the specific question of the right to strike, the Committee of Experts has\nobserved that: “since the maintaining of the employment relationship is the\nnormal consequence of recognition of the right to strike, its exercise [legal\nexercise, be it understood] should not result in workers being dismissed or\ndiscriminated against”. 371\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nPersons protected and types of act of anti-union discrimination in strikes\ncontexts\nThe principles upheld by the Committee on Freedom of Association consider\nillegitimate any discrimination act against union leaders for organizing legitimate\nstrikes; such protection also covers trade union members and workers who\nparticipate in strikes. Specifically, the Committee supports the general principle\nthat “no person shall be prejudiced in his employment by reason of his trade\nunion membership or legitimate trade union activities whether past or present”. In practice, the Committee has maintained that:\n­ No one should be penalized for carrying out or attempting to carry out a\nlegitimate strike;\n­ The dismissal of workers because of a strike, which is a legitimate trade\nunion activity, constitutes serious discrimination in employment is\ncontrary to Convention No. 98;\n­ When trade unionists or union leaders are dismissed for having exercised\nthe right to strike, the Committee can only conclude that they have been\npunished for their trade union activities and have been discriminated\nagainst;\n­ Respect for the principles of freedom of association requires that workers\nshould not be dismissed or refused re-employment on account of their\nhaving participated in a strike or other industrial action. It is irrelevant\nfor these purposes whether the dismissal occurs during or after the strike. Logically, it should be irrelevant that the dismissal takes place in advance\nof a strike, if the purpose of the dismissal is to impede or penalize the\nexercise of the right to strike;\n­ The use of extremely serious measures, such as dismissal of workers for\nhaving participated in a strike and refusal to re-employ that, implies a\nserious risk of abuse and constitutes a violation of freedom of association;\n372\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\n­ No one should be deprived of their freedom or be subject to penal\nsanctions for the mere fact of organizations or participating in a peaceful\nstrike. The Committee of Experts has also affirmed the protection of workers and union\nofficials against acts of anti-union discrimination and has confirmed that most\nnational legislation contains general or detailed provisions which protect workers\nagainst acts of discrimination, although the level of protection may vary.",

    "text": "The\nCommittee emphasizes that this protection “constitutes an essential aspect of\nfreedom of association” and, in its opinion, “is particularly desirable for trade\nunion officers and representatives, because in order to be able to perform their\ntrade union duties in full independence they must have the guarantee that they\nwill not be prejudiced on account of their trade union office”. This opinion\ncoincides with that of the Committee on Freedom of Association. As stated previously, regarding the right to strike, the Committee of Experts has\nemphasized that the maintaining of the employment relationship is a normal\nlegal consequence of recognition of the right to strike and that dismissals against\nstrikers should not ensure from the exercise of this right. The Committee recalls\nthat:\n[…] in some countries with the common-law system strikes are regarded as\nhaving the effect of terminating the employment contract, leaving employers free\nto replace may dismiss strikers with new recruits. In other countries, when a\nstrike takes place employers may dismiss strikers or replace them temporarily or\nfor an indeterminate period. Furthermore, sanctions or redress measures are\nfrequently inadequate when strikers are singled out through some measures\ntaken by the employer (disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, dismissal); this\nraises a particularly serious issue in the case of dismissal, if workers may only\nobtain damages and not their reinstatement. In the Committee’s view, legislation\nshould provide for genuine protection in this respect, otherwise the right to strike\nmay be devoid of content. 373\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nThe Committee on Freedom of Association has stated its concern with regard to\nlegislation in particular countries which permits dismissal without an indication\nof motive:\nIt would not appear that sufficient protection against acts of anti-union\ndiscrimination, as set out in Convention No. 98, is granted by legislation in cases\nwhere employers can in practice, on condition that they pay the compensation\nprescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal, dismiss any worker if the true\nreason is the worker’s trade union membership or activities. The Committee of Experts has expressed a similar view in referring to appropriate\nprotection that should be enjoyed by workers against acts of anti-union\ndiscrimination in general, according to Article 1 of Convention No. 98.",

    "text": "Similarly,\nwhen considering the possibility that trade union leaders could be dismissed\nwithout an indication of the motive, the Committee on Freedom of Association,\nin its consideration of the case, requested the government to take steps “with a\nview to punishing acts of anti-union discrimination and making appeal\nprocedures available to the victims of such acts”. From the complaints submitted to it, the Committee on Freedom of Association\nhas identified acts of anti-union discrimination due to legitimate strike action,\nincluding dismissal, the practice of blacklisting of persons who have participated\nin strikes (particularly with a view to refusing to hire them), the transfer of trade\nunion officials, the need for “certificates of loyalty” if workers are to be engaged\nor retained in service, demotion, compulsory early retirement, penal sanctions\nand other acts. Protection machinery\nIn the view of the Committee on Freedom of Association, “as long as protection\nagainst anti-union discrimination is in fact ensured, the methods adopted to\nsafeguard workers against such practices may vary from one state to another”. Similarly, the Committee of Experts has stated that protection against acts of anti-\n374\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nunion discrimination may “take various forms adapted to national legislation and\npractice, provided that they prevent or effectively redress anti-union\ndiscrimination, and allow union representatives to be reinstated in their posts and\ncontinue to hold their trade union office according to their constitutes’ wishes”. The Committee of Experts has noted, by way of example, that in order to\nguarantee the protection of trade union officials in some cases legislation\nestablishes preventive machinery by requiring that certain measures taken\nagainst trade union representatives or officials must first be authorized by an\nindependent body or public authority (labour inspectorate or industrial\ntribunals), a trade union body or workers’ council. In most legislation, however,\nthe emphasis is laid on compensation for the prejudice suffered. The Committee\non Freedom of Association has pointed out that “one way to ensuring the\nprotection of trade union officials is to provide that these officials may not be\ndismissed, either during their period of office or for certain period thereafter\nexcept, of course, for serious misconduct”. The Committee of Experts has stressed that anti-union dismissal cannot be\ntreated in the same way as other kinds of dismissal, because freedom of\nassociation is a fundamental right.",

    "text": "In the view of the Committee, this means that\ncertain distinctions must be made, for example as regards conditions as to proof,\nsanctions and remedies. In this regard, the Committee on Freedom of Association has pointed out that:\nThe existence of basic legislative provisions prohibiting acts of anti-\nunion discrimination is not sufficient if these provisions are not\naccompanied by effective procedures ensuring their application in\npractice. Thus, for example, it would often be difficult, if not impossible,\nfor a worker to furnish proof an act of anti-union discrimination of\nwhich has been the victim. This shows the full importance of Article 3\nof Convention No. 98, which provides that machinery appropriate to\n375\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nthe national condition shall be established where necessary, to ensure\nrespect for the right to organize. The supervisory bodies have also frequently and in a decisive manner\ndemonstrated their concern regarding situations in which the measures taken to\neliminate or prevent acts of anti-union discrimination have proved to be\nineffectual or insufficient persuasive or where the examination of complaints in\nthis regard has been insufficiently expeditious. In this connection, the Committee\non Freedom of Association has stated that:\n­ \nRespect for the principals of freedom of association clearly requires\nthat workers who consider that they have been prejudiced because\nof their trade union activities should have access to means of\nredress which are expeditious, inexpensive and fully impartial. ­ \nLegislation must make express provisions for appeals and\nestablished sufficiently dissuasive sanctions against acts of anti-\nunion discrimination to ensure the practical application of Articles\n1 and 2 of Convention No. 98. Furthermore, in the light of excessive slowness- sometimes years- by the legal\nsystem in dealing with disciplinary sanctions against trade unions, the Committee\non Freedom of Association has stated that:\nCases concerning anti-union discrimination contrary to Convention No.98\nshould be examined rapidly, so that the necessary remedies can be really\neffective. An excessive delay in processing cases of anti-union discrimination, and\nparticularly a lengthy delay in concluding the proceedings concerning the\nreinstatement of the trade union leaders dismissed by the enterprise, constitute a\ndenial of justice and therefore a denial of the trade union rights of the persons\nconcerned. The Committee of Experts has in its turn stressed that “the existence of general\nlegal provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination is not enough if\n376\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nthey are not accompanied be effective and rapid procedures to ensure their\napplication in practice”.",

    "text": "Whether the machinery is based on prevention or compensation, experience has\nshown that similar problems arise in practice and concern in particular the\nslowness of the proceedings, the difficulties relating to the burden of proof and\nthe possibility for the employer to acquit himself by paying compensation which\nbears no proportion to the seriousness of the prejudice suffered by the worker. The Committee therefore emphasizes the necessity of providing expeditious,\ninexpensive and impartial means of preventing acts of anti-union discrimination\nor resolving them as quickly as possible. Legislative provisions are insufficient if they are not accompanied by sufficiently\ndissuasive sanctions to ensure their practical application. Similarly, the\nCommittee of Experts considers that “the reinstatement of the dismissed worker,\nincluding retroactive compensation, [is] the most appropriate remedy in such\ncases of anti-union discrimination”. The Committee on Freedom of Association\nhas also stated that job reinstatement should be available to those who were\nvictims of anti-union discrimination. Abuses in exercising the right to strike\nThe right to strike, which is held by the ILO supervisory bodies to be\nfundamental, is not an absolute right and its exercise should be in line with the\nother fundamental right of citizens and employers. Consequently, the principles\nof the supervisory bodies cover only legal strikes, that is, strikes which are carried\nout in compliance with national legislation where this does not undermine the\nbasic guarantee of the right to strike as have been described in the preceding\nsections on the principles of freedom of association in connection with strikes. Indeed, as the Committee on Freedom Association has stated, “the conditions that\nhave to be fulfilled under the law in order to render a strike lawful should be\nreasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the\nmeans of action open to trade union organizations.” 377\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nAbuses in the exercise of the right to strike may take different forms, ranging\nfrom its exercise by groups of workers who may be excluded from this right, or\nfailure to comply with reasonable requirement in declaring a strike to damaging\nor destroying premises or property of the company and physical violence against\npersons.

    "text": "For instance, in recent case re-examined by the Committee of\nFreedom of Association in connection with strike of air traffic controller, which\ngave rise to dismissal and criminal proceedings, the Committee considers that the\ngovernment could not be asked to comply with the request for a return to work\nof the dismissed workers as demanded by the compliment, given that during the\nstrike the passwords of the radar system has been changed, thereby endangering\nthe security of the population. In more general terms, in examining situations\ninvolving abuses in the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee on Freedom\nof Association has decided as follows:\nThe principles of freedom of association do no protect abuses consisting of\ncriminal acts while exercising the right to strike. Penal sanctions should only be\nimposed as regards strikes where there are violations of strike prohibitions which\nare themselves in conformity with the principle of freedom of association. All\npenalties in respect of illegitimate actions linked to strikes should be\nproportionate to the offence or fault committed and the authorities should not\nhave recourse to measures of imprisonment for the mere fact of organizing or\nparticipating in a peaceful strike. The Committee considered that some of the temporary measures taken by the\nauthorities as a result of a strike in an essential service (prohibition of the trade\nunion activities, cessation of the check-off of the trade union dues, etc) were\ncontrary to the guarantees provided for in Article 3 of Convention No.87. The\nCommittee drew the Government’s attention to the fact that the measures taken\nby the authorities to ensure the performance of essential services should not be\nout of proportion to the ends pursued or lead to excesses. 378\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nIn case of peaceful strikes, the Committee has stated that” the authorities should\nnot resort to arrests and imprisonment in connection with the organization of or\nparticipation in peaceful strike: such measures entail serious risks of abuse and\nare a grave threat to freedom of association”; “no one should be deprived of their\nfreedom or be subject to penal sanctions for the mere act of organizing or\nparticipating in peaceful strike.” Most legislation restricting or prohibiting the right to strike also contains clauses\nproviding for sanctions against workers and trade unions that infringe these\nprovisions. In some countries, striking illegally is a penal offence punishable by a\nfine or term of imprisonment. Elsewhere, engaging in unlawful strike may be\nconsidered as an unfair labour practice and entail civil liability and disciplinary\nsanctions.",

Even in\nsuch cases, both excessive recourse to the courts in labour relations and existence\nof heavy sanctions for strike action may well create more problems than they\nresolve. Since the application of disproportionate penal sanctions does not favour\nthe development of harmonious and stable industrial relations, if measures of\nimprisonment are to be imposed at all, they should be justified by the seriousness\nof the offences committed. In any case, a right of appeal should exist in this\nrespect. In addition, certain prohibitions of, or restrictions to, the right to strike which\nare in conformity with the principles of freedom of association sometimes\nprovide for civil or penal sanctions against strikers and trade unions which violate\nthese provisions. In the view of the Committee, such sanctions should not be\ndisproportionate in the seriousness of the violation. 379\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nOther principles involved\nHiring of workers to replace strikers\nThe Committee on Freedom of Association only considers the replacement of\nstrikers to be justified: (a) in the event of a strike in an essential service in which\nstrikes are forbidden by law, and (b) when a situation of acute national crisis\narises. The Committee of Experts has considered that:\nA special problem arises when legislation or practice allows enterprises\nto recruit workers to replace their own employees on legal strike.

The Committee considers that this type of provision\nor practice seriously impairs that right to strike and affects the free\nexercise of trade union rights. Compulsory closing down, intervention of the police, and access by\nmanagement to the enterprise\nThe Committee on Freedom of Association has concluded that for providing in\nnational legislation  the closing down of the enterprise, establishment or business\nin the event of strikes is an infringement of “the freedom of work of persons not\nparticipating in a strike and disregards the basic needs of the enterprise\n(maintenance of equipment, prevention of accidents and the right and the right\nof employers and managerial staff to enter the installations of the enterprise and\nto exercise their activities).”",

Similarly, in the view of the Committee, “the authorities should resort to calling\n380\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nin the police in a strike situation only if there is a genuine threat to public order\nand governments should take measures to ensure that the competent authorities\nreceive adequate instructions that might undermine public order.

Furthermore, the Committee on Freedom of Association has concluded that\nrequesting police assistance in order to allow access by members of management\nto the enterprise when occupied by strikers does not represent a violation of the\nprinciples of freedom of association. As has just been explained in connection\nwith the compulsory closing down of the enterprise during a strike, the\nCommittee has established the right of employers and managerial staff to enter\nthe installations of the enterprise and to exercise their activities during a strike.

Body of principles on the right to strike\nAs a summary of the preceding sections, there follows a synthesis of the principals\nand minimum rules of conduct established by the Committee on Freedom of\nAssociation as regards the right to strike. A. Consideration of the right to strike as a fundamental right to be enjoyed by\nworkers and their organizations (trade unions, federations and\nconfederations), which is protected at international level, provided that the\nright is exercised in a peaceful manner. B.  General recognition of the right to strike for workers in the public and\nprivate sectors, with the sole possible exceptions being members of the\narmed and police forces, public servants who exercise authority in the name\nof the state and workers employed in essential services in the strict sense of\nthe term (the interruption of which could endanger the life, safety or health\nof the whole or part of the population), or in situations of acute national\ncrisis. C. The principals of freedom of association do not cover strikes of a purely\npolitical nature, although they do not cover those which seek a solution to\nmajor issues in economic and social policy. D. A blanket ban on sympathy strikes could lead to abuse. Workers should be\nable to enjoy the right to take such action when the initial strike they are\nsupporting is itself lawful. E. A minimum safety service may be imposed in all cases of strike action when\nsuch minimum services are intended to ensure the safety of persons, the\nprevention of accidents and the safety of machinery and equipment. F. A minimum operational service may be established (in the undertaking or\ninstitution in question) in the case of strikes in public utility services and in\n382\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\npublic services of fundamental importance; employers’ and workers’\norganizations and the public authorities should be able to participate in\ndetermining this minimum service.",

How do you assess the Ethiopian law of strike in light of the ILO\nprinciples on the right to strike elaborated herein above? Identify\npossible inconsistencies, if any, between Ethiopian law of strike and the\ninternational standard in this regard? 2. Ethiopian law of strike classified enterprises into two (i.e. essential\nservice providers and other than them). The essential service providers\nhave been prohibited from calling on strike while the others are\nallowed. Under the ILO jurisprudence there is a third category so-called\n“minimum service requirement” in which enterprises under this\ncategory are in principle allowed to call on strike but they will be\nrequired to provide a minimum service in a day or a week. The main\nreason for such an arrangement is the concern that a non-essential\nservice may become essential if the service is withheld for longer\nduration. Do you feel the importance of incorporating the “minimum\nservice requirement” principle into the Ethiopian law of strike? Please\nlist out enterprises that may fall under this category? 8.4.",

    "text": "Employment Dispute Settlement under the Civil Service Regime\nHerein above we have discussed the organs, their jurisdictions and modalities of\ndispute settlement within the framework of the labour law. Under this section,\nwe will elaborate the organs and modalities of employment dispute settlement\npertaining to the civil service employment regime. It must be clear from the outset that unlike the labour employment regime where\nwe have individual and collective employment disputes, we do not have a\ncollective employment dispute within the civil service employment sector. The\n384\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nreason for this outcome is the absence of freedom of association in the civil\nservice as a result of which civil servants in Ethiopia do not have an organized\nand collective voice. In the absence of employees’ organizations/associations,\nthere are no collective employment disputes in the civil service sector. Thus, for\nthe civil service sector, we are limited to resolving individual employment\ndisputes. The other point to note is, though labour law is within federal jurisdiction, civil\nservice employment regime is both a federal and regional subject matter in the\nsense that federal civil servants are regulated by the Federal Civil Servants’\nProclamation while the civil servants in the various regions are to be governed\nby legal instruments within their respective regions. Hence, for the purpose of\nthis text, we are to rely on the provisions of the Federal Civil Servants’\nProclamation No. 1064/2017. All the same, many of the regional instruments in\nthis regard are almost verbatim reproductions of the federal instrument. Thus, it\nis hoped that regional instruments will be indirectly addressed as well. As stipulated in the Civil Servants’ Proclamation No. 1064/2017, the relevant\norgans of employment dispute settlement in the civil service sector are:\nDisciplinary Committee; Grievance Handling Committee; Administrative\nTribunal; Federal First Instance Court Federal Supreme Court and Federal\nSupreme Court Cassation Division. Their roles and responsibilities have been\nspelt out thereunder. Article 71(1) provides that any government institution shall establish a\ndisciplinary Committee which shall conduct formal disciplinary investigation\nand thereby submit recommendation to the head of the government institution. This organ is relevant in cases where a civil servant is suspected of committing\nserious misbehaviour that needs further investigation to determine the\ntruthfulness of the allegation or otherwise. Pending an investigation, a civil\nservant may be suspended from duty and salary. However, there should be\nconvincing reasons to suspend.",

    "text": "Towards this end, Article 72 of the Federal civil\nServants Proclamation provides the following:\n385\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\n1) Any civil servant may be suspended from duty if it is presumed that;\na)  He may obstruct the investigation by concealing, damaging or\ndestroying evidence related to the alleged offence;\nb) He may commit additional offence on the property of the government\ninstitution;\nc)  The alleged offence is so grave as to demoralize other civil servants or\nnegatively affect the public trust towards civil servants; or\nd) The disciplinary offence may lead to dismissal. 2) A civil servant may be suspended from duty and payment of salary only\nfor a maximum period of two months. If the suspension period of a civil servant from duty and payment of salary expires\nbefore his dismissal or reinstatement is determined the head of the government\ninstitution may extend the suspension for a period of up to one month. The\nextended period of suspension shall be with payment of half salary if the delay is\ncaused by the complexity of the investigation of the disciplinary charge or\nwithout payment of salary if the cause of delay is attributable to the civil servant\nhimself (Article 72(6). Unless a decision of dismissal is rendered against a\nsuspended civil servant, the salary withheld during suspension shall be paid to\nhim without interest (Article 72(4). It is stipulated that disciplinary measure shall not be taken against a civil servant\nwho has committed an offence which entails simple disciplinary penalty unless\nsuch measure is taken within six months (Article 73(1). However, this provision\nfailed to address two outstanding issues. First, what is “simple disciplinary\npenalty”? Second, when does the six month period begins to count from the date\nthe misdeed was committed or from the date the government institution became\naware of the misdeed? Simply disciplinary penalties has been listed as oral warning; written warning\nand a fine up to 15 days’ wage (Article 69(2) and hence misdeeds that entail one\n386\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nof these penalties would be categorized as simple. Nevertheless, with respect to\nthe relevant time when the six months period of limitation begins to count, the\ncivil service proclamation does not seem to offer solution. If it could be of some\nhelp to establish analogy, the Labour Proclamation has a provision in this regard.",

    "text": "The right of an employer to terminate an employee on disciplinary grounds shall\nlapse after thirty working days from the date the employer knew the existence of\nthe ground of termination (emphasis added: Article 27(3). The Civil Servants’ Proclamation has another category of misbehaviour the so –\ncalled “rigorous disciplinary penalty.” Rigorous disciplinary penalties are fine up\nto three months’ salary; down grading for the period of up to two years; and\ndismissal (Article 69(3). For this category of misbehaviour, no disciplinary charge\nshall be brought against a civil servant who has committed an offence entailing\nrigorous disciplinary penalty in addition to criminal liability, unless the\ndisciplinary charge is brought within the time limit provided for in the Criminal\nCode for such criminal offence (Article 73(2). Thus in order to determine the\nperiod, there is a need to consult the Criminal Code. However, what happens if\na certain rigorous disciplinary misbehaviour is not punishable under the Criminal\nCode? How its time limit should be assessed. For instance, unjustified and\nrepeated absenteeism or neglect of duty by being alcoholic or drug addict has\nbeen categorized as rigorous disciplinary misbehaviour (Article 70(4) and (6). But\nthey do not seem to have been criminalized by penal provisions. Thus there seems\nto exist a legal vacuum in this regard. Under the Criminal Code, limitation period\nfor bringing a criminal action for the most serious one is twenty-five years; while\nfor the least serious crime the period is three years (Article 217(1) Criminal\nCode). Be that as it may, the Disciplinary Committee is not a decision-making organ in\nthe sense that its power is limited to merely offering recommendations to the\nhead of the government institution. It is up to the head of government institution\nto approve, amend or reverse the recommendation. Disciplinary measure is an\nin-house measure that is separate and independent of any court proceedings or\ndecisions. 387\nEmployment Dispute Settlement Mechanisms\nIn disciplinary proceedings, it is the government institution which appears as a\nplaintiff before this Committee while the civil servant is a defendant. Members\nof the Committee are to be nominated by the administration. All government\ninstitutions are required to establish disciplinary committee. Under the labour\nlaw there is no express duty imposed by law for the establishment of a\ndisciplinary committee. Whether to establish disciplinary committee or not is left\nfor private ordering (work rules or collective agreements).",

    "text": "Article 76 of the Civil Servants’ Proclamation introduces another organ which is\nentrusted to handle another specific task. It prescribes that “any government\ninstitution shall establish a Grievance Handling Committee that conducts\ngrievance inquiry and submits recommendations to the head of the government\ninstitution”. “ Grievance” for this purpose is defined as “a complaint of a civil\nservant that could not be resolved through discussion conducted with the civil\nservant’s immediate supervisor or with concerned officer and should be addressed\nthrough a formal review procedure” (Article 74). This committee is set up to\nentertain grievances submitted by civil servants against their employers (i.e. the\ngovernment institution). Similar to that of the Disciplinary Committee, the Grievance Handling\nCommittee is an in-house dispute settling organ tasked to provide\nrecommendation to the head of the government institution. Unlike the\ndisciplinary committee where the government institution assumes the role of the\nplaintiff and brings the dispute to the attention of the Committee, the civil\nservant will be the one who submits her claim or grievance against the\ngovernment institution to the Grievance Handling Committee. This is one of the\nmodalities of implementing the constitutional stipulations which dictate that\ngovernmental measures need to be transparent and accountable. Once the internal dispute settlement organs are tested, if there still exists\ngrievance or dissatisfaction, there exists an appellate procedure within the\nexecutive organ. For this purpose, an Administrative Tribunal which entertains\ncivil service employment disputes and render decision is established pursuant to\n388\nA Textbook on Ethiopian Employment Law: Notes, Cases and Materials\nArticle 79(1) of the Proclamation. It is named as “Civil Servants Administrative\nTribunal”. The Tribunal shall have chambers which examine and decide on\nappeal cases (Article 79(2). Each chamber shall have a chairperson and two\nmembers designated by the Civil Service Agency (Article 79(3). Orders and\ndecisions of the Administrative Tribunal shall be considered as orders and\ndecisions of any civil cases (Article 80(3). It is stated that any governmental\ninstitution up on receiving the decision of the Administrative Tribunal shall\nexecute the decision within ten working days (Article 82(1). Where the decision\nis not executed within 30 days, the Administrative Tribunal shall refer the case\nto the Federal First Instance Court in order to enforce the execution of the\ndecision (Article 82(2).",

    "text": "Although the decision of the Administrative Tribunal on question of facts is final,\nany party who claims that the decision of the Administrative Tribunal has an\nerror of law, may appeal to the Federal Supreme Court within 60 days up on\nreceiving the decision of the Administrative Tribunal (Article 81(5). Indeed,\nbased on the constitutional stipulation, any final decision of court of law in which\nfundamental error of law has been observed can still be submitted to a cassation\ndivision as an additional procedural remedy. Generally, the dispute settlement machinery in the civil service sector moves\nfrom simple to complex in the sense that internal remedy within the\nadministrative unit is the first level which is local remedy; then moves to the\nAdministrative Tribunal forum which is quasi-judicial administrative remedy; it\nis after exhausting the local and administrative remedies that the judicial remedy\nwould be employed. -----------------End of textbook-----------------\n389\nReference Materials\na) \nBooks and Other Publications\nAbebe Teferi & Admit, Zerihun (2001) Ethiopian privatization programme: Rational,\nPerformance and Impact on the labour market.
