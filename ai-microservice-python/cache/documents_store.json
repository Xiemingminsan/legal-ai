Because of the nexus between and among state, power \nand law, a constitution does not only govern the relationship between the governed \nand the government (government understood as the agency or machinery of the \nstate), but also lays down the basis and justification of state and government, as \njuridical concept and structure.  State as a Juristic Person From the point of Political Science, the concept of state\ncomprises three fundamental elements \n 1. A community of people, \n 2. With a definite territory, and  \n 3. A political power. The Concept of “Constitution” A constitution as sham/cosmetic or real has a principal \nfunction. A Constitution as a Charter for Governments: At minimum, an authoritative \nconstitutional text would more often sketch the fundamental modes of legitimate \ngovernmental operations. A constitution as a guardian of fundamental rights: The \nconstitution as covenant, symbol, and aspiration: In so far as a constitution is a covenant by \nwhich a group of people agree to (re) transform themselves from mere state into a nation,\nWhat is Sovereignty? Sovereignty is supreme authority, which at the international plane means not legal \nauthority over any other state, but rather legal authority which is not dependent on any \nother sovereignty; in the strict and narrowest sense of the term, it implies, therefore, \nindependence all around, within and without the borders of the country. Forms of Sovereignty in International Law\n1. Internal or territorial  sovereignty\nEach of these states is exclusively sovereign inside its own territory, in the sense that it has \n\"exclusive competence\" or \"domestic jurisdiction\" and a monopoly of power over its \nterritory and inhabitants. It was recognized that sovereignty, in relation to a piece of the world, is the right to \nperform state functions therein to the exclusion of any other state, i.e. territorial \nsovereignty entails the sole right to show state activities.

External Sovereignty\n The state is externally sovereign in the sense that it is not subject to another state or\nany higher authority (against its will).  They include the requirement that states refrain from threatening or employing\nforce in their international interactions, cooperate with one another, and adhere to \nthe principles of equal rights and peoples' self-determination. 3.",

Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources\n It is a well-established principle of international law that every state has\nunrestricted disposal of its natural wealth and resources inside its borders, a \nprinciple known colloquially as permanent sovereignty over natural resources.  This principle gives birth to some fundamental state rights, such as the right to\nregulate foreign investors' admission and activities, as well as the right of the state \nto pursue its own social-economic and environmental policies. The Concept of Nationality\nNationality of an individual is his quality of being a subject of a certain state. Hence, it is \none of the attributes given to a physical person. The five most common modes of acquiring nationality are:\n1. birth, \n2. naturalization,  \n3. reintegration,  \n4. annexation and  \n5.

Constitutionalism is the broader concept of adherence to constitutional \nprinciples and the rule of law. Constitutionalism pertains to two kinds of relationships.  The relationship between government and nationals/citizens, residents/ is the first\ncategory – the substantive.  The second (the formal) refers to the appraisal of one branch of government vis-à-\nvis the other; and to their inter-relationship.

Rule of Law: Constitutions establish the framework for the rule of law by setting\nout the fundamental principles, rights, and responsibilities governing the \nrelationship between the government and its citizens. They provide a legal \nstructure that ensures accountability and fairness in the administration of \njustice. 2. Protection of Rights: Constitutions safeguard the rights and freedoms of\nindividuals and minorities. They often include a Bill of Rights or fundamental \nrights provisions that protect citizens' civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, \nassembly, religion, and equality before the law. 3. Limits on Government Power: Constitutions establish the structure of\ngovernment and define the powers and limitations of each branch executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. They prevent any single entity or individual from \naccumulating excessive power, promoting checks and balances among different \nbranches. G-MANs \nPage 6\n4. Stability and Governance: A constitution provides stability by outlining the\nfundamental principles and institutions of a state. 5. Legal Framework for Society: Constitutions provide a legal framework that\ngoverns the conduct of government institutions, public officials, and citizens. They set the standards for lawmaking, policymaking, and decision-making \nprocesses. 6. Resolution of Conflicts: Constitutions serve as a mechanism for resolving\ndisputes and conflicts within a society. They provide a legal framework for \naddressing disagreements and ensuring that conflicts are resolved according to \nestablished principles. 7.",

    "text": "Adaptability and Evolution: While providing a foundational structure,\nconstitutions can also be amended or interpreted to adapt to changing societal \nneeds, values, and circumstances. They can evolve to reflect new challenges and \ndevelopments in society. 8. Legitimacy and Citizenship: Constitutions contribute to the legitimacy of a\ngovernment by establishing the basis for citizenship, governance, and the social \ncontract between the state and its citizens. Process of making constitution \n \n1. Drafting the Constitution: Based on the consultations and research, the\nconstituent assembly begins the drafting process. 2. Debates and Discussions: The drafted constitution is subject to debates,\ndiscussions, and revisions within the constituent assembly. Different \nviewpoints and proposals are considered, and compromises may be made to \naddress conflicting interests and reach consensus on key provisions. 3. Public Participation and Feedback: Constitutions often undergo public\nscrutiny and feedback through public hearings, town hall meetings, or other \nforms of public engagement. This allows citizens to provide input, voice \nconcerns, and contribute to the shaping of the constitution. 4. Ratification and Approval: Once the constitution is finalized, it goes through\na process of ratification or approval. 5. Adoption and Implementation: After receiving approval, the constitution is\nformally adopted and becomes the supreme law of the land. 6. Amendment Procedures: Constitutions often include provisions for their own\namendment to accommodate changes and evolving needs of society.

Emergency Powers:\nNB: Ethiopia follows a dualist approach, which means that for an international treaty to \nbecome part of domestic law, it must be explicitly incorporated through legislation. This \nincorporation process ensures that the provisions of the treaty are enforceable within the \nnational legal system. G-MANs \nPage 8\nClassification of constitution\n1. Rigid vs. Flexible: \nRigid Constitution: A rigid constitution is one that requires a special and usually more \ncomplex procedure for its amendment than the ordinary legislative process. Amendments \nto rigid constitutions typically need approval from a special body or through a referendum. Flexible Constitution: A flexible constitution can be amended or changed by the same \nprocess as regular laws. There's no distinct procedure for amending the constitution, and it \ncan be modified by the ordinary legislative process. 2. Written vs. Unwritten: \nWritten Constitution: A written constitution is explicitly documented in a single written \ndocument or a series of documents. It encompasses fundamental laws and principles \ngoverning the state. Unwritten Constitution: An unwritten constitution lacks a single, formally written \ndocument but is based on a combination of statutes, conventions, judicial decisions, and \ntraditions. The United Kingdom is an example of a country with an unwritten constitution. 3. Presidential vs. Parliamentary: \nPresidential Constitution: In a presidential system, the executive branch, led by a \npresident, is separate from the legislative branch. The president is elected independently of \nthe legislature and holds significant powers. Parliamentary Constitution: In a parliamentary system, the executive branch derives its \nlegitimacy from the legislative branch. The head of government is often the Prime Minister, \nwho is elected by the legislature and is accountable to it. 4. Federal vs. Unitary: \nFederal Constitution: A federal constitution divides powers between a central (national) \ngovernment and regional (state or provincial) governments. Each level of government has \nits own powers and responsibilities. Unitary Constitution: In a unitary system, all powers are concentrated in the central \ngovernment. Local governments may exist but derive their authority from the central \ngovernment and can be altered or abolished by it. 5. Republican vs. Monarchical: \nRepublican Constitution: A republican constitution is one in which the head of state is not \na monarch. The country is governed either by elected officials or representatives.",

    "text": "Disadvantages of Hybrid System of Government: \n Potential for Power Struggles: Tensions between the President and Prime Minister\nmay lead to power struggles and conflicts.  Unclear Lines of Authority: The division of powers may lead to ambiguity in roles\nand responsibilities.  Cohabitation Challenges: Political differences between the President and Prime\nMinister from different parties may result in governance challenges.  Executive Gridlock: Disagreements between the executive branches can result in\ngridlock and hinder decision-making.  Complex Governance: The dual leadership structure can complicate decision-\nmaking processes and governance.  Potential for Instability: Lack of synchronization between the President and Prime\nMinister may lead to political instability.  Overlapping Functions: Overlaps in executive functions can create confusion and\ninefficiencies in governance.  Limited Accountability: Diffused accountability due to the shared responsibilities\nmay diminish individual accountability.  Difficulty in Legislative Passage: Policy implementation may face hurdles in the\nlegislature due to differing party alignments.  Inefficiency in Crisis Handling: Divided leadership might impede swift responses to\ncrises or emergencies. Electoral systems \n An election within an electoral system is a formal process where individuals or\ngroups make choices among candidates, parties, or propositions to determine \nrepresentation or decisions within a political framework.  Elections serve as a fundamental mechanism for citizens to participate in\ndemocratic decision-making and select their representatives. G-MANs \nPage 19\n It is the usual mechanism by which modern democracy fills offices in the legislature,\nsometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local governments. Characteristics of election \n Universal Suffrage: Universal suffrage denotes that all eligible citizens have the\nright to vote without discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or social status. It ensures inclusivity in the electoral process.  Free and Fair: Elections should be conducted freely and fairly, allowing for equal\nopportunities for all candidates and voters. This ensures that the electoral process is \ntransparent and unbiased.  Periodicity: Elections occur at regular intervals predetermined by law or\nconstitutional provisions. This regularity provides stability and allows for \ndemocratic turnover of power.  Secret Ballot: The secret ballot ensures the confidentiality of individual votes,\nallowing voters to make choices without fear of coercion or intimidation, ensuring \nthe integrity of the electoral process.  Competitive Nature: Elections involve competition among candidates or parties\nseeking office. This competition fosters political debate, diverse viewpoints, and the \npresentation of various policy options.  Accountability: Elections hold elected representatives accountable to the electorate.",

It ensures that individuals entitled to vote are properly registered \nand allowed to participate in the election.  Public Campaigns: Candidates and political parties engage in public campaigns to\ninform voters about their policies, manifestos, and agendas. These campaigns aim to \npersuade voters and garner support.  Independent Electoral Commission: An independent electoral commission oversees\nthe electoral process, ensuring its fairness, transparency, and compliance with \nelectoral laws and regulations.  Voter Participation: Voter participation reflects the percentage of eligible voters\nwho actually cast their ballots. High voter turnout signifies active citizen \nengagement in the democratic process. Types of Electoral system \n1 Majoritarian Systems: This system is designed to produce a majority government\nby awarding a majority of seats to the winning party or coalition. Example: United Kingdom, Canada, India, the United States, and many Common \nWealth states. G-MANs \nPage 20\n Feature: Examples include Alternative Vote (AV), where voters rank candidates by\npreference in single-member constituencies. There are many variants of the Majoritarian system, the most prominent of which \nis simple majority (relative majority) also known as First Past the Post (FPP) and \nAbsolute Majority. 2. Proportional Representation system: Allocate seats in proportion to the overall vote\nshare received by each political party. Example: Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium ,Denmark, Holland, Greece ,Spain, \nAustria, Mexico, Portugal, Japan, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Poland ,Hungary, Iceland, \nBrazil, Nicaragua, Norway, Finland, Venezuela, and South Africa.  Features: Various types exist:\nList PR: Parties present lists of candidates, and seats are allocated based on the \npercentage of votes each party receives.  Single Transferable Vote (STV): Multi-member constituencies where voters rank\ncandidates in order of preference.  Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP): Combines single-member constituencies\nwith proportional representation through party lists. 3. Hybrid or Mixed Systems: A hybrid system of election, also known as a mixed or\nsemi-proportional system, combines elements of different electoral systems, typically \nblending features from both majoritarian (like first-past-the-post) and proportional \nrepresentation systems.",

Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) Structure: Incorporates both single-member \nconstituencies (majoritarian aspect) and party-list proportional representation \n(PR) elements.  Allocation of Seats: Seats in the legislative body are divided between those directly\nelected in constituencies and those allocated proportionally based on parties' \noverall vote share.  Two Types of Ballots: Voters cast two ballots - one for a candidate in their\nconstituency (direct vote) and another for a political party (party vote) at the \nnational or regional level.  Constituency \nRepresentatives: \nCandidates \nwho \nwin \nin \nsingle-member \nconstituencies become directly elected representatives.  dditional or List Seats: Supplementary seats are allocated to parties based on their\noverall percentage of the party vote to ensure proportional representation.  Compensation Mechanism: List seats are used to balance any disproportionality in\nthe directly elected constituency seats to achieve overall proportionality. G-MANs \nPage 21\n Thresholds: May include a threshold for a party to be eligible for list seats,\nensuring that only parties crossing a certain vote threshold can gain proportional \nrepresentation.  Balancing Majoritarian and Proportional Aspects: Strives to achieve a balance\nbetween the majoritarian aspect (directly elected representatives) and the \nproportional aspect (ensuring fair party representation).  Coalition Dynamics: Often leads to the formation of coalition governments due to\nthe proportional representation element, encouraging parties to negotiate and form \nalliances to gain a governing majority.  Constituency Size: The number of directly elected representatives per constituency\ncan vary, impacting the level of proportionality in the system.  Voting Strategies: Offers voters the flexibility to consider both their preferred\ncandidate in their constituency and their preferred party for overall \nrepresentation.

Module Introduction\nDear student, we have been discussing so far about the major issues of constitutional\nlaw with a focus its governance aspects. As I have stated to you in the previous\ncourse material, one of the principles of constitutional law is the principle of\nfundamental rights and freedoms and due to its prominence, it needed to be treated\nas a separate module in your course work. It is a well deserved apportionment of the\nmaterial considering the significance the FDRE, as well as many other constitutions\nof the world for that matter, attach to those rights and freedoms. For example almost\none-third of the constitutional text is covered by these rights and freedoms, and the\nstringent amendment procedures stipulated in Article 104 and 105(1) of the\nconstitution also reiterate this importance. Article 13(1), by imposing a duty on both\nfederal as well as regional legislative, executive and judicial organs to protect and\nenforce those rights and freedoms gives the provisions of chapter III of the\nconstitution a special position. We are, therefore, going to discuss Chapter III of the\nconstitution. 8.2. The nature of the fundamental rights and freedoms\nThe name ‘fundamental rights and freedoms’ is used to describe all those rights\nincluded in chapter III which the constitution later on classifies them as Human\nRights and Democratic Rights. Dear student, what do you think is the difference\nbetween ‘right’ and ‘freedom’ or do you think they are synonymous? Can the\nAmharic translation of the terms be of any use, i.e., ‘mebit’ e’na ‘netsanet’? In jurisprudence and law, a right is the legal or moral entitlement to do or refrain\nfrom doing something or to obtain or refrain from obtaining an action, thing or\nrecognition in civil society. Rights serve as rules of interaction between people, and,\nas such, they place constraints and obligations upon the actions of individuals or\ngroups (for example, if one has a right to life, this means that others do not have the\nliberty to murder him). There are two main modern conceptions of rights: on the one hand, the idea of\nnatural rights holds that there is a certain list of rights enshrined in nature that cannot\nbe legitimately modified by any human power.",

    "text": "On the other hand, the idea of legal\n1\nLegal issues Telegram channel  \n                     Join us – @EthioLegalIssues\nrights holds that rights are human constructs, created by society, enforced by\ngovernments and subject to change. Consequently, two fundamental controversies exist that surround the notion of\nrights: First, there is the question of the basis for rights (on what basis rights can be\nsaid to exist, are they natural or are they a human construct). Second, there is the\nquestion of the content of rights (what the rights of a person actually are, can a\nperson possess unlimited rights to do whatever s/he can or is there a possible limit\non it, if so where does that limit begin or end). The word freedom, on the other hand, is claimed to have originated in England. English had its beginnings about fifteen hundred years ago, when the \"Angle-ish\"\nspoken by Angles and Saxons separated from other Germanic languages as the\nAngles and Saxons themselves, crossing the water to settle in what they would call\n\"Angle-land,\" separated from other Germanic tribes. Since that time, no word has\nbeen of more significance to English speakers than freedom. This word was not\ncarried to England as part of the Angles' and Saxons' Germanic language heritage,\nnor was it imported from another language. Instead, it seems to have been a\nhomemade invention, put together from two existing Germanic words to form a\ndistinctive concept. The elements of freedom are free and doom, to use the modern spellings. Free\noriginally meant \"beloved\" and is related to the word ‘friend.’ By the time English\ncame into being, free had evolved to take on its modern meaning, with the idea that\none who is beloved is a friend, free from bondage. The development of doom is\nmore complicated. Nowadays we think of doom as a judgment or as an unhappy\nfate. A thousand years ago, in the time of the early English language, doom had a\ndifferent emphasis. It did indeed mean judgment, but it meant a considered\njudgment, related to the present-day deem. Put free together with doom and you have the condition of being judged to be free. It\ninvolves being free and thinking about it, being free and accepting the responsibility\nfor making the judgments that being free entails. This word has made its way into\nthe world human rights regime by the renowned activist President Roosevelt of the\nUS in the 1940s.",

The following is an excerpt from his 6 January\n1941 State of the Union’s Speech that he delivered to Congress;\n‚In the future days which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world\nfounded upon four essential human freedoms; The first is freedom of speech\nand expression-everywhere in the world; The second is Freedom of worship. That is, freedom of every person to worship whomever (be it God, or any other\ndeity/deities) in his own way-everywhere in the world; The third is freedom\nfrom want, which, translated into world terms, means economic\nunderstandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its\ninhabitants-everywhere in the world; The fourth is freedom from fear, which,\ntranslated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to\nsuch a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position\nto commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor-anywhere in the\nworld. That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world\nattainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very\nantithesis of the so-called \"new order\" of tyranny which the dictators seek to\ncreate with the crash of a bomb.‛\nTherefore, the terms ‘right’ and ‘freedom’ speak almost the same situation though\nthe latter seems wider in scope and applies to particular notions of rights as\npropounded by Roosevelt. It is almost universally recognized that when we speak of\nthose four aspects of human rights, they are referred to as ‘freedoms’ than ‘rights’\naccordingly it is hardly possible to hear someone saying ‘right to religion’ rather\nthan ‘freedom of religion’. The same is true for freedom of expression, freedom of\nassociation, etc. ‘ Freedom from want’ is now what we call the right to development\nwhich was also enunciated in the UN Charter, and in the International Bill of Rights.1\nHuman Rights had been, at least until the post WWII a domestic affair into which no\nother country had a say except the sovereign states themselves. And the normal\napproach towards the rights has been to provide them within the constitutional\ndocument so that the government’s power would be restrained to that extent.",

Then after, beginning\nwith the Universal Declaration of Rights, many international human rights\ninstruments have come into existence.

Chapter III of the constitution is, therefore, laying down the minimum national\nhuman rights standards that the state has promised to ‘respect, protect and fulfill.’ These are the three levels of obligations that human rights legislations impose on\nthose states that provide the fundamental rights and freedoms. First, the state has\nthe obligation to ‘respect’ those rights in the sense that it must not, by its actions,\nviolate the right to life of individuals. Second, the state has the duty to ‘protect’ the\nfundamental rights and freedoms of individuals by, for instance, prohibiting murder\nthrough its criminal laws and punishing those who violate the criminal law. Finally,\nthere is another aspect of the fundamental rights and freedoms which is a\ncontroversial one. This is the obligation to ‘fulfil.’ A state must be able to provide\nhealth care services, safe and clean drinking water, as well as adequate housing for\nthe right to life to be of any meaning. For instance, the Indian Supreme court had\nonce found the state in violation of the right to life because of its failure to provide\nhousing for slum dwellers. This obligation is controversial basically because of the\nfact that it requires resources to fulfil the rights and accordingly there is a tendency\nto classify the rights into those that are only aspirational and those which are\nenforceable immediately, which we will be looking into them in detail later on in the\nsection of classification of rights. Dear student, are you following our discussion?",

    "text": "I hope you do and it is very\nimportant that you should read time and again the provisions of the constitution\nChapter III for the proper understanding of the nature of the rights. Respect, Protect and Fulfil: In relation to Women’s Human Rights (AI)\nThe obligations of states under human rights law are often summarized under\n4\nLegal issues Telegram channel  \n                     Join us – @EthioLegalIssues\nthree categories:' respect, protect, fulfil'. The obligation to respect focuses directly on what the government does through\nits organs, agents and the structures of its law. Is there a constitutional provision\nfor equality between men and women in all spheres? Does the law restrict some\nemployment to men, and discriminate against women? Do some agents of the\nstate such as the police, regularly sexually assault and extort money from\nprostitutes with impunity? Does the state compel women to be sterilized as part\nof a population reduction policy? Does it deny information on contraception to\nadolescent girls in the name of respecting a dominant cultural or religious claim? The State is also required to protect women's human rights. This principle\n'requires from the state and its agents measures necessary to prevent other\nindividuals or groups from violating the integrity, freedom of action, or other\nhuman rights of the individual'. By this, the state has undertaken, for example, to\nprevent acts of direct and indirect discrimination against women. This could\ninclude preventing discriminatory acts that restrict women and girls from going\nto school by allowing sexual harassment to continue unabated, or to ensure that\na woman is not deprived of equal rights to employment by giving her husband\nthe \npower \nto \nveto \nher \nemployment \ncontract. The obligation to fulfil 'requires the state to take the measures necessary to\nensure, for each person within its jurisdiction, opportunities to obtain\nsatisfaction of those needs, recognized in the human rights instruments, which\ncannot be secured by personal efforts'. This obligation for women and men\ncovers everything from providing a healthy environment and clean water to,\nmore generally, upholding the conditions necessary for women's NGOs to form\nand function. 1.3 Classification of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms\nDear student, now we are going to see the classification in general of rights and\nfreedoms and then we shall be looking into the way that the Ethiopian constitution\ntries to classify the rights.",

While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights made no distinction\nbetween these forms of rights, during the drafting of the two other Covenants there\nhad arose a difference of opinion in either coming up with a single and universal\nhuman rights instrument that included, as did the UDHR, both civil and political\nrights as well as Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or splitting them into two\nseparate instruments. The latter idea was supported by capitalist countries such as\nthe US that favoured only the civil and political rights while the former had been\nhighly supported by the then socialist countries. Finally, the latter view had been\naccepted and two covenants had been adopted in 1966, which came into force after\nten years, in 1976. What is the difference between the two types of human rights? Civil and political rights are those rights that are sometimes referred to as first-\ngeneration rights that primarily protect individual rights such as right to life,\nprohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the\nright to liberty and security of person, the freedom of movement, freedom of\nassociation, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, right to equality, the right to\nvote and be elected, etc. The economic, social and cultural rights, on the other hand, are, as its name implies,\nare rights that relate to the socio-economic, and cultural wellbeing of individuals and\ngroups within the country, and they are referred sometimes as second generation\nrights. In these category of rights are the right to non-discrimination, the right to\nwork, the right to just and favourable conditions of work, the right to form trade\nunion, the right to social security, the right to protection of family life, the right to\nadequate standard of living, the right to health, the right to education, and the right\nto participate in cultural life. Dear student, what kind of difference do you see in these listing of rights?",

( By the right to health we mean, among others,\nthe provision of at least basic health care services to individuals by the state). Write\nyour opinion on the following lines. 6\nLegal issues Telegram channel  \n                     Join us – @EthioLegalIssues\nIt is a question of what it takes to respect individual’s freedom of expression and\nwhat it takes to provide to individuals and communities basic health care services by\nthe state. The former involves no or little resource for its rendition while the latter\nmust be supported by investing huge amount of resources by the state to construct\nhealth care centres, employ health officers, and provide equipments as well as\nmedicines. That distinguishes the two rights and accordingly, the wordings of the\ncovenants differ fundamentally. One of the operative provisions of each of the\nCovenants stipulates the following in a manner that loudly speak of their basic\ndifference;\nArticle 2(1) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2\nEach State Party to the present covenant undertakes to respect and ensure to all\nindividuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognised in\nthe present covenant without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex,\nlanguage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth\nor other status. Article 2(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\nEach State Party to the present covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and\nthrough international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and\ntechnical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving\nprogressively the full realisation of the rights recognised in the present covenant\nby all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative\nmeasures. In these provisions we see very distinct wordings that make the two rights very\nmuch different. The nature of states’ obligations in the case of the civil and political\nrights is a kind of an immediate effect and not subject to any form of resource\navailability. And states are supposed to respect and ensure those rights to all\nindividuals within their territory. When it comes to the economic and social rights,\n2 Ethiopia is a party to this Covenant. In fact it is a party to a total of seven international and regional human \nrights instruments.",

And states are only required to take\nsuch steps to the extent of their available resources in the realisation of those rights\nand accordingly, the rights are not immediately achievable rather only with\nprogressivity. b) First, Second and Third Generation rights\nThe division of human rights into three generations was initially proposed in 1979\nby the Czech jurist Karel Vasak at the International Institute of Human Rights in\nStrasbourg. He used the term at least as early as November 1977. Vasak's theories\nhave primarily taken root in European law, as they primarily reflect European\nvalues. His divisions follow the three watchwords of the French Revolution: Liberty,\nEquality and Fraternity. First-generation human rights (FGHR) deal essentially with liberty and participation\nin political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, and serve to\nprotect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include,\namong other things, freedom of speech, the right to fair trial, freedom of religion,\nand voting rights. They were first enshrined at the global level by the 1948 Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. There are many writers who propound that when first\ngeneration human rights are limited this directly limits second generation rights in\nthe sense that where there are limits on freedom of speech and expression it is not\nlikely that people in that state will have adequately enforceable socio-economic\nrights. Second-generation human rights are related to equality and began to be recognized\nby governments after World War I. They are fundamentally social, economic, and\ncultural in nature. They ensure different members of the citizenry equal conditions\nand treatment. Secondary rights would include a right to be employed, rights to\nhousing and health care, as well as social security and unemployment benefits. Like\nfirst-generation rights, they were also covered by the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. Third-generation human rights are those rights that go beyond the mere civil and\nsocial, as expressed in many progressive documents of international law.",

While section 32 of the constitution\nprovides ‘the right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the\nenforcement of the rights conferred by this Part (which enumerates the fundamental\nrights) is guaranteed’, those directive principles of state policy are just considered as\nnorms of aspiration.

But the fact that it is the Council which is supposed to implement the declaration\nand also considering the fact that the closest institution to the public’s day-to-day life\nis the Council, it is somehow superfluous to provide a separate prerogative for the\nHouse to issue such emergency proclamations. Or do you think there are\ncircumstances where the House’s independent power might be of some purpose? Please discuss this point with your friend. By its nature, a state of emergency is temporary and permits the government to\nsuspend some of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. And our\nconstitution is clear in terms of the temporariness of the measure in the sense that it\nprovides various levels of periods for which a declared state of emergency could\nlast.",

A further communication shall be\nmade, through the same intermediary, on the date on which it terminates\nsuch derogation. The Human Rights Committee that is established under the UN to oversee the\nimplementation of this Covenant in its general comment stated the following:\n‘Measures derogating from the provisions of the Covenant must be of an\nexceptional and temporary nature. Before a State moves to invoke article 4, two\nfundamental conditions must be met: the situation must amount to a public\nemergency which threatens the life of the nation, and the State party must have\nofficially proclaimed a state of emergency. The latter requirement is essential\nfor the maintenance of the principles of legality and rule of law at times when\nthey are most needed.

So, what might be considered\nas a situation that justifies the issuance of state of emergency is an important aspect\nof the overall concept of derogation. The answer to this question is in ICCPR Art 4(1)\nby saying that it has to be ‘a public emergency that threatens the life of the nation.’ This is\nfar from being clear in providing an understanding of the circumstances that give\nstates the right to suspend some of the rights of the covenant.

This\nprovision gives us the answer to our query. The circumstances can be put in four\nmain headings and a fifth point which is applicable to most of those four\ncircumstances. Accordingly, the situations that might justify the declaration of state\nof emergency under the Ethiopian constitutional system are;\n External invasion,\n A break down of law and order which endangers the constitutional order,\n A natural disaster, and\n An epidemic. These are the four main points that might be cited by the Council of Ministers while\ndeclaring a state of emergency. However for the last three headings, an additional\ntest must be met before they become as valid grounds for suspension. This is the fact\nthat where a break down of law and order, a natural disaster or an epidemic can\nadequately be controlled by the regular law enforcement agencies and personnel\nsuch as the civilian police force, those grounds may not be raised as justification for\nthe declaration of state of emergency. Thus, while the grounds themselves can be\nconsidered as requirements of legality, this latter condition is a requirement of\nproportionality in the sense that the state of emergency may not be proportional in\ncircumstances where the ordinary police force can quell the unrest without any need\n16\nLegal issues Telegram channel  \n                     Join us – @EthioLegalIssues\nof suspension of the fundamental rights and freedoms through the state of\nemergency. However, this requirement as is phrased in the provision seems to be applicable only\nto the second point. Nonetheless, there is no reason to isolate the proportionality test\nas applicable only to a break down of law and order and not for natural disaster or\nepidemic. It is worth noting the Human Rights Committee’s statement with regard\nto Article 4(1) of the ICCPR which is of the identical nature with Art 93(1) of the our\nconstitution;\nThe issues of when rights can be derogated from, and to what extent, cannot be\nseparated from the provision in article 4, paragraph 1, of the Covenant\naccording to which any measures derogating from a State party’s obligations\nunder the Covenant must be limited ‚to the extent strictly required by the\nexigencies of the situation‛.

In the opinion of the Committee, the possibility of restricting\ncertain Covenant rights under the terms of, for instance, freedom of movement\n(art. 12) or freedom of assembly (art. 21) is generally sufficient during such\nsituations and no derogation from the provisions in question would be justified\nby the exigencies of the situation.

This provision again confuses the approach once adopted for\nclassification of the rights by introducing a new approach, which is classification of\nthe rights and freedoms into ‘political and democratic rights.’ Now one will have to\nlook into those rights from the human rights part that are of political in nature and\nwhich are not, or we will have to assume that by ‘political rights’ the constitution is\nreferring to the ones which are already referred to as ‘human rights.’ Dear student,\nwhich one do you think is the appropriate line of thinking?

    "text": "You will have to bear in your mind that\nEthiopia is a party to the ICCPR since 11 June 1993, and also carefully consider Art\n13(2). Art 1, which establishes the federal state structure, Art 18, which prohibits\ninhuman, cruel, inhuman treatment or punishment, slavery, servitude and safeguard\nagainst being imprisonment for failure to fulfill contractual obligations, Art 25,\nwhich provides the right to equality, Art 39(1) & (2) which stipulate about the right\nto self-determination including secession are the ones that are non-derogable rights\nunder the FDRE constitution. However, the ICCPR adds to these listings the right to\nlife, prohibition of the retroactive application of criminal law, the right to recognition\neverywhere as a person, and freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Thus,\nthere is a very difficult situation here to respond to because while the international\nstandard stipulates that the right to life and the other rights are not to be suspended\nunder any circumstance, the national standard as provided in the constitution makes\nit a derogable right. Do you think in such circumstances the international obligation\nof the state is going to have precedence over its national commitment and\naccordingly people who might be killed or whose right to religion has been curtailed\nthrough a declared state of emergency can bring an action against the state under the\ninternational covenant that Ethiopia is a party? This is quite controversial an issue that it calls for the interpretation of the\nconstitution. And Art 13(2) provides that the provisions of Chapter III must be\ninterpreted in conformity with the country’s international human rights obligations. However, Art 93 is not part of chapter III, apparently making it out of the ambit of\nArt 13(2). Nonetheless, this provision is speaking about the fundamental rights and\nfreedoms and the question is whether or not those fundamental rights and freedoms\n19\nLegal issues Telegram channel  \n                     Join us – @EthioLegalIssues\nare subject to derogation in times of emergency. To that extent, the international\nhuman rights instruments must be consulted even if the Martial Law provision (Art\n93) is out of chapter III of the constitution.

Thus, it is suggesting that let alone to\nreduce from those listed as non-derogable the idea is to expand those fundamental\nrights and freedoms that can never be derogated, and this way there is a\nprogressively growing tendency to use only peaceful and less aggressive measures\nto calm any state of unrest.

In those provisions of the Covenant that are not listed in article 4,\nparagraph 2, there are elements that in the Committee’s opinion cannot be\nmade subject to lawful derogation under article 4. Some illustrative\nexamples are presented below. a) All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity\nand with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. Although this right, prescribed in article 10 of the Covenant, is not\nseparately mentioned in the list of non-derogable rights in article 4,\nparagraph 2, the Committee believes that here the Covenant\nexpresses a norm of general international law not subject to\nderogation. This is supported by the reference to the inherent\ndignity of the human person in the preamble to the Covenant and\nby the close connection between articles 7 and 10. b) The prohibitions against taking of hostages, abductions or\nunacknowledged detention are not subject to derogation. The\nabsolute nature of these prohibitions, even in times of emergency,\nis justified by their status as norms of general international law. c) The Committee is of the opinion that the international protection of\nthe rights of persons belonging to minorities includes elements that\nmust be respected in all circumstances. This is reflected in the\n20\nLegal issues Telegram channel  \n                     Join us – @EthioLegalIssues\nprohibition against genocide in international law, in the inclusion\nof a non-discrimination clause in article 4 itself (Para 1), as well as\nin the non-derogable nature of article 18. d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population without grounds\npermitted under international law, in the form of forced\ndisplacement by expulsion or other coercive means from the area\nin which the persons concerned are lawfully present, constitutes a\ncrime against humanity.",

    "text": "Chapter one:\nThe notion of state and constitutional approaches of state :\nintroduction to constitutional law\n1.1. Theoretical views about state\nThere are two major views as to whether society can live without government or\nnot\nv Many people think that government is indispensable for an orderly life\nv However, the supporters of anarchism, a political thought, argue that\ngovernment is evil and unnecessary. They believe that individuals can live in\npeace\nwithout government\nas\nthey\nhave\nthe\ncapacity\nfor\nrational\nunderstanding, compassion and cooperation. Ø Concerning state and government two questions are posed\nv Do we, as human beings need government? v If yes what kind of government? v The need to consider the nature of human being\nis supposed to be\nimportant when we sought\ntheories of state and\ngovernment. Thomas\nFleiner, asserted beyond that it is necessary to understand the nature of\nhuman being before proposing any theory. Ø let’s examine the views of the two known political thinkers regarding these two\nquestions, John Lock and Thomas Hobbes;\nØ To reach at their conclusion, they first tried to understand the nature of human\nbeing. It is on their conception to human being that they proposed certain way\nouts. Ø But the question is, what are the essentials of human nature that are important\nfor understanding the state and its authority? 1\nØ In other words, why does the human being in contrast to animals need a state\nand if humans are unable to survive without state, what should the state look\nlike? Ø The answers to the above questions can possibly depart from two extreme\nassumptions;\nü Humans are by nature good beings, all humans are angels. In this case the\nstate would have to be seen as a negative and unnecessary construct\nbecause angels do not need a state any more. ü Humans are by nature are evil beings; all humans are devils and cannot\nbe forced by any state authority to obey orders or live peacefully. ü However, no theory or philosopher basis his theory from the two extreme\nalternatives. Most philosophers take the middle ground and general\nunderstanding that they are neither as good as angels nor as bad as devils. ØThomas Hobbes\nAccording to the opinion of Hobbes,\nthe behavior of human being is\ndetermined by three motives\n§ The desire for gain\n§ The desire for safety and\n§ The desire for reputation\nThese motives cause individuals to be selfish, quarrelsome and aggressive.",

    "text": "They\nalways look for more power and wealth advancing their interests at the expense of\nothers. Hobbes wrote; the life a man may be compared to a race that\nhas no other goal than to be foremost. Hence, the egocentric human behavior leads to a perpetual violence and war in the\nnatural conditions. 2\nHobbes also imagined a condition where society may live without state, the state of\nnature. The concept is not indicating past condition but a condition which might\nexist in the absence of a politically organized society. According to him, in the state of nature life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish\nand short. Hence, under the state of nature peace, prosperity and development is\nimpossible. Ø Therefore, Hobbes concluded government is necessary because life without it\nwould be horrible. Ø Men are anxious about death and therefore they are inclined to seek peace and\nfulfill their material needs through labor for their own sake. Ø Mankind is a rational creature and wants to end the warlike condition of state of\nnature. This desire convinces all persons to come together and enter into a\nsocial contract, according to which they transfer their power to a form of\ngovernment. Ø Hobbes pointed out that the state is a vital instrument to accomplish peace and\nsecurity and a good life can only be achieved through the state. v On how to reconcile individual liberty and the power of the government,\nHobbes strongly supports the supremacy of the sovereign. v He advocated for strong and absolute ruler vested with an omnipotent\npower so far as it can keep the peace and security of its people. v The sovereign is not answerable to its people nor is subject to the law\nbecause repressive government is better than no government. v Therefore, in Hobbes’s theory of state and government, peace and\nsecurity takes the central place. v This is because during his time he had experienced the English civil war\nwhere social fabric had collapsed, violence being the order of the day. So,\nfor fear of this violence and lack of peace he supported for an absolute\n3\nruler than respecting the rights of individuals and facing with the\npossibility of anarchism. Ø John Lock\nLock described the state of nature as a state of perfect freedom where individuals\ndecide on their actions, dispose of their possessions and persons as they think fit\nwithin the limits of the law of nature. v He assumes that human beings are rational creatures-accordingly he thought\nthat even in a state of nature individuals can live together according to\nreason without a common superior authority to judge between them. v Members of the society, though they did not create a political society, enjoy\nnatural rights even prior to the creation of the government which they enjoy\nas human beings. v Let’s see the response of Lock to the questions as to whether government is\nnecessary and the kind of government most suitable for society. v Just like Hobbes, Lock underlines the indispensability of government as the\nstate of nature is fraught with disadvantages, inconvenience and dangers\nbecause the full enjoyment of human rights is exposed to the encroachment\nof others. v Therefore, protection to life, liberty and property cannot be guaranteed in the\npre-society order as many things would be lacking notably;\nü An established, settled and accepted law by the common consent\nü An impartial judge that would decide according to established law\nü An authority to execute the punishment imposed upon law breakers. v Therefore, to exploit the missing elements in the state of nature, lock\nproposes to form a political society to rule upon the consent of the majority.",

    "text": "Political society is established on the basis of freely given consent. However,\nwhen individuals decide to form society they surrender their power of\n4\npreserving their rights or punishing wrong doers to the government but\nindividuals did not surrender to the community all the rights but only\nexecutive power. To generalize\nWhile Hobbes was in favor of absolute government, lock was interested in limiting\npower of government. According to the later, the only justification for the\nexistence of state is its ability to protect individual rights better than individuals\ncould do their own in pre-political society. Ø The thinking of the two political philosophers is influenced by the conditions of\nthe time where they were living. Ø During Hobbes time, peace and stability was central political thought but during\nlock’s time the emphasis shifted to protecting liberty and controlling despotism\n(dictatorship). Ø Both thinkers agree the fact that individuals entered in to a compact to form\npolitical community to end the uncertainty in the state of nature. However, the\nthinkers differ significantly on the nature of government to be established. Ø Regarding Hobbes he argued individuals by entering in to the social contract\n(compact) agree to subordinate themselves to the authority of an absolute\nsovereign. Ø But lock maintained that individuals still retain their inalienable natural rights\neven under government. According to him, the supreme ruler cannot take away\nfrom any man any part of his property without his consent. But if it deals\narbitrarily and improperly it violates the essential conditions of the social\ncompact and the trust under which it holds power. 5\nØ Lock further proposed the legislature be separated from the executive to protect\nthe rights of citizens. If the legislature and executive become absolute and\nenslave the people, the people are entitled to replace it with another government. 1.2.

    "text": "The\nnormative statementthat claims\nconstitution comes prior to government, not thevice versa started to\nhave a force of law under the emergence of modern constitutions. In light with this, Bradley and\nWade define a constitution as something antecedent to a government; government being merely\nthe creation of a constitution. A constitution is not the act of a government, but of a people\nconstituting a government. 6\n® In order for the constitutional plan of legitimate rule\nto work, the constitution had to be\ndistinguished from ordinary law. As an act that constituted legitimate public power in the first\nplace, the constitution could not emanate from the ruler himself. It needed a different source. Thus, the source of legitimate political power was found in the people who had decided to form a\npolity and to whom the constituent power was ascribed. So , the second basic\nfoundation\nmodern constitutions\nis the entrenchment and commitment towards the will of the people as\nsource\nof\nlegitimate public/political power\n. This is one the reasons /factors that make\nconstitution to be to be a higher law\n®MODERN constitutions, then, changed the essence of internal sovereignty. Instead of\nmonarchical or parliamentarian sovereignty, the legitimating principle of the modern constitution\nwas made to be popular sovereignty. But unlike the sovereign monarch or the sovereign\nparliament the people were incapable of ruling themselves. They needed representatives to\ngovern in their name. Democratic government is government by mandate and as such stands in\nneed of being organize, hence, popular sovereignty is largely to be exercise through\nrepresentatives. ®However, the mandate was not conferred upon the representatives unconditionally. In\ncontrast to the unlimited power of the British Parliament and the French King, the revolutionaries\nwanted to establish a limited government, limited in substance and limited in form. The first was\na decision in favor of individual freedom that gained primacy over the raison d’état and found\nlegal expression in catalogues of fundamental rights. The second followed from the conviction\nthat freedom could best be secured if governmental power was not concentrated in one hand but\ndistributed among various branches of government. The limits in scope and time as well as the\nseparation of powers also required determination in the form of legal rules……\n®Therefore, constitutions constitute representative democracy+ limitation of power, guarantying\nfundamental rights that would have primacy over public power/democratic decision, Separation\nof power to further secure liberty/fundamental rights+ rules of law /legal rules and independent\njudiciary and constitutional review institution that will help for actual determination. …",

Hence, the concept of constitutional law is broader than constitution. While the later refers to the document of the constitution the former refers and\nincludes not only the constitutional document but also basic principles and rules\nnot found in such document. A part form the constitution, conventions and customs,\npractices of the other government organs can be sources of constitutional law. – For example judicial review is part of the American constitutional law and yet no\nprovision in the constitution clearly recognizes it. The doctrine emerged by judicial\npractice. Other examples include working principles and procedures\nof the\nfundamental organs of the state but not the state written in the constitution. For\nexample presidential /royal assent of laws , vote of no confidence, working rules\nand procedures of parliament, principles and rules of constitutional interpretation…. These are conventional principles deemed to be part of constitutional law. In short not all constitutional principles are found in the constitutional documents. Thus, constitution is lower in scope than constitutional law. Constitutionalism:\nConstitutionalism combines the idea of a government limited in its action and the\nmechanisms to ensure a rule of law and accuntable government. Thus, the ideal of\nconstitutionalism requires constitutions to provide a definition and limitation of the powers of\ngovernment, commitment to adherence to the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights. In a net shell, concept of constitutionalism rests on two pillars:\n1. The existence of certain limitations imposed on the state particularly in its\nrelationships with citizens based on certain clearly defined set of core values. 11\n2. The existence of clearly defined mechanisms for ensuring that the limitations\non the government are legally enforceable. In relation to the second pillar, constitutionalism has certain core, irreducible\nand possibly minimum contents of values with a well defined process and\nprocedural mechanisms to hold government accountable.",

In this respect\nconstitutionalism puts mechanisms to control the majority so as to respect the\nrights of the minorityand the individual, to protect or overt POSSIBLE the tyranny\nof the majority. Hence, constitutionalism is mainly the antithesis of wide and arbitrarypower. So, it\nis concerned with the presence of checks and limitations on governmental power as\nwell as their observation practice. It is noted that all states have constitutions but\nnot all of them observe constitutionalism. HARMONY:\nThough democracy and constitutionalism seems to have certain contradiction, in\nmodern days the concept of democracy and constitutionalism can easily be\nreconciled. For a democracy to be stable and function properly it needs a\nconstitutional framework: for constitutionalism to thrive, it needs democratic\npedigree. Therefore, democracy can be taken as on essential pre-requisite for\nconstitutionalism. Because on the basis of democracy, constitutionalism tries to\nrectify its flows and ultimately both benefits the majority, the individual and the\nminority. Constitutionalism puts a limit on democracy for the benefit of the\nindividual and the minority, and thereby for all. 15\nRule of law : Definition\nA first step in defining Rule is to ask what the purpose of law is? Although there is\nsome philosophical disagreement about why we have law, there is widespread\nacceptance that the law has essentially three purposes:\n® Law is should protect against anarchy and the Habbesian was of all against\nall\n® Law should allow people to plan their affairs with reasonable confidence\nthat they can know in advance the legal consequences of various actions. ® Law should guarantee against at least some types of official arbitrariness. To put comprehensively, the purpose of law is to provide a government of security,\npredictability and reason. According to prof. Fallon, the purpose of law is served by five “elements of the\nrule of law”\n1. Capacity of legal rules to guide people in the conduct of their affairs\n2. People should be ruled by the law and abbey it\n3. Stability (to facilitate planning law should be stable)\n4. Supremacy of legal rules –the law should rule officials as well as ordinary\ncitizens\n5. Courts should be available to enforce the law and should employ fair\nprocedure.",

    "text": "Rule of law is interrelated with a number of constitutional values such as:\n- Supremacy of the con-\n- Fundamental rights\n- Judicial independence and\n- Separation of powers\nEach of these values helps to contribute for the realization of rule of law. Rule of law means “a government of laws not of men”\n16\nRule of men is the opposite of the concept which is open to power abuse\nmanifested by arbitrary, Unreasonable and discriminatory practices. According to A.V. Dicey rule of law denotes the following specific principles:\n1. Principle of “Legality”No one should be punished except for breach of law,\nA person should not be punishable except for a clear violation of law\nestablished in the ordinary legal procedure before the ordinary courts. - A law issued in advance and publicized\n- No retroactive law, No secret and arbitrary law\n- Fair hearing and access to justice\n2. The rule of law demands, what dicey called, equal subjection to the law i.e.\nequal treatment to all. The law should not discriminate against people on\ngrounds of race, sex, religion, social back ground and soon. No one should\nbe above the law, every indivtrion what ever his social position must be\nsubject to the ordinary law of the country and a merable to the ordinary court. 3. When the law is broken there must be a certainty of punishment. The law\ncan only rule. If it is applied in all times and circumstances, not selectively. 4. When rights are violated citizens should be able to seck remedy through the\ncourts, inseparable form this is judicial independence. The capacity of courts\nto protect rights of citizens depends on their independence from outside\npressure. 5. Finally, legal rules must be clearly defined to avoid uncertainty. The rule of law demands the principle of “legality”. In this respect, so long as these\nare a legal rule permitting the taking of an action, the requirement of legality is\nobserved. But, are legal rules sufficient to meet the test of rule of law? 17\n- Some see rule of law as a principle much more than legal rules. Natural law\ntheariste in particular contend that the law’s authority derives form the\nprinciple of natural law and the state law must conform o those principles. - On the other hand, postiatuist thinkers argue that the law is valid, whether\ngood or gad. It may be criticized for its content, nevertheless, it remain\nbinding unless legally altered.",

It must\nencompass\nequality and human rights without unjustifiable\ndiscrimination among groups of people. Constitutional supremacy, constitutional rerriew and independent ourersight bodies\n(ex-office of ombudsman) play a vital role to bring about the prevalence of rule of\nlaw. Constitutions normally contain supremacy clauses declaring void any conflicting\nlaws, such provisions protect rule of law by maintaining legal structures, checks\nand balances and guarantees of basic rights and freedoms. Another, means to preserve fundamental principles and values is by making the\nconstitutional amendment process burdensome. Separation of power\nThough Plato is the first thinker to reflect on the dangers of concentration of power,\nthe doctrine is credited most to the French political philosopher Montesquieu who\nprofoundly elaborated the idea in his book entitled “the spirit of the law”published\nin 1748. 18\nMontesquieu believed that human was the highest virtue to be pursued by any\nsociety. He said “constant experience shows us that every man invested with power\nis apt to abuse it and to carry his authorigh as far as it will go”. According to him “when the legislative and executive power are united in the same\nperson or organ, there can be no liberity”\nAfter identifying three functions he proposed ------ legislative, executive and\njudiciary. This theory has influenced the orgns. Of governments in the world\nthough there are variations in its application. Checks and balancers\nThis theory assumes that strict separation of power may create three institutions\nwhich can abuse their respective unchecked powers, therefore, to avoid such abuse,\ncheck and balance is needed to balance the powers of the different branches, that is\nto make them roughly equal, so that no branch can completely dominate the other\nbranches.",

The essence of the doctrine is therefore, one of\nconstitutionalism or limited government. To this affect the main control that the principle adopted is to vest the three types\nof governmental power legislative, executive and judicial in three separate and\nindependent institutions with the personnel of each being different and independent\nof each other. There are four touching elements to the doctrine\n1. The government shall be divided in to three branches; the legislative,\nexecutive and judiciary\n2. There are three separate functions interested to each of them, law making,\nlaw enforcement and adjudication of laws. 3. No person should have a double membership in any of those three agencies. 4.

Being sovereign means:\n- No one can compel you in a civil court without your consent. - The only way you can lose rights are to injure the equal rights of other\nsovereigns and there by commit crime. - In our country, the NNP, not the government is the sovereigns in its internal\nsense and the government exercises “sovereign”power explicitly delegated\nto it by them through a written constitution……\nSovereignty\nThe doctrine of sovereignty originated in Europe at the time when modern nation-\nstates emerged around the fifteenth century. During the middle ages, a multitude of\nauthorities, Princes, aristocrats, local kings, the church-wielded power until they\nwere engulfed by the nation state. Sovereignty, one of the fundamental legal and political concepts has different\ndimensions; Internal and external: legal and political. Internal and external sovereignty\nInternal sovereignty Refers to the possession of supreme authority over the\ninternal affair of a state. That means, the possessor of internal sovereignty has the\nfinal decision making power. It follows that all individuals, groups and institutions\nmust respect the will of the sovereign power. 21\nExternal sovereignty Implies the status of a country in the international erena i.e.\nits ability to deal with other states independently it embodies the idea of National\nindependence and self government. Heywood pointed out “only if a nation is sovereign are its people capable of\nfashioning their own destiny in accordance with their own needs and interests. To\nask a nation to surrender its sovereignty is tantamount to asking its people to give\nup their freedom. This aspect of sovereignty recognizes the right of a state over persons and things\nfound inside it. External sovereignty is not. However, absolute as states have forfeited many of the\ntraditional attributes of sovereignty,. When it comes to international law, the UN\ncharter authorizes member states to intervene in another member states as when\nthere is gross human rights violation committed by it. For example, in the 2011\npopular uprising against the government of Libya, the UN Security Council passed\na resolution authorizing member states to take “all necessary measures”against\ngovernment forces in the name of protecting the civilian population. This is\nreferred as “principle of responsibility to protect “\nLegal and political sovereignty\nLegal sovereignty (de jure sovereignty) signifies the supreme power as defined by\nlaw. The holder of legal sovereignty is determined by looking at the law of the\nconcerned state.",

Unlike legal sovereignty, political sovereignty is not in any may based upon a\nclaim to legal authority but is concerned simply about the actual distribution of\npower that is de facto, sovereignty. It therefore implies, the supreme political power having the ability to command\nobedience because of his monopoly over the use of coercive force. 22\nHence, legal sovereignty needs to be complemented with political sovereignty. If\npolitical sovereignty is lacking, the ruler lacks the means to enforce his commends. Political sovereignty alone without legal sovereignty is not legitimate and is\nsusceptible to be collapsed as a result of popular resistance. The idea is neither legal sovereignty nor political sovereignty alone establishes a\nviable authority (sovereignty).

In a hierarchy one institution derives its authority form another institutional, where\nas in a transaction, two or more institutions derive their authority independently of\none another. In parliamentarianism, the executive holds a subordinate position compared to the\nlegislature and its term of power may be terminated by the legislature, but, in\npresidential system neither the executive nor the legislative organ is subordinate\nrather they are independent and to govern the country, they must bargain.",

The constitutional allocation of power follows three categories of powers;\n® Exclusive powers\nfederal\nState\n® Concurrent powers\n® Reserved (residual powers)\nExclusive powers\n37\nIn theory the exercise of an exclusive power as described in the federal constitution\nis left entirely to the entity to which it has been attributed. Looking at the federal level there are some functions exclusively given to the\nfederal government which by their very nature covers the entire territory of the\nfederation and apply equally to all member states and citizens. Exclusive power is very much necessary because there are some matters which\ncome under the exclusive control of the regional governments. Because shared\npower can through process be absorbed by the central government. The Ethiopian constitution generally follows the American and Swiss forms of\ndistribution of powers despite it has also the feature of holding together federations\nlike India. According to art-50(2) the federal government and the states shall have\nlegislative, executive and judicial powers. In the creation of Ethiopian constitution although there were no any constituent\nstates which have prior existence to the central government, from the constitutional\npower structure of the federation one may argue for coming together federation. In the Ethiopian constitutional setup the states are the holders of the residual\npowers according to art- 52(1) excepting the powers of taxation, for undesignated\npowers of taxation are as per art-99 left to determine by the joint session of the two\nhouses. Therefore, logically speaking art-99 shall be treated as an exception to art-52(1). Besides, the constitution lists some powers of states under art-52(2) which seems a\nkind of exemplary lists. 38\nIt is important to remind that the powers of the federal government are not only\nlimited to art-51. Reading the reserve clause, one may say that any power not\nmentioned under art-51 belongs to the states.",

    "text": "But, other provisions of the\nconstitution also indicate additional powers are entrusted to the federal government. During the constitutional drafting art-51 was intended to cover the whole powers\nconferred to the federal government, while the other lists were meant to allocate\nfrom the lists to the different departments of the federal government. ( Horizontal\ndivision of power)\nYet what appeared as a final product did not reflect the above thinking for we find\npowers seem to be additional under art-55, 74 and 77. Some of the federal government’s powers not mentioned under art-51 but indicated\nelsewhere include the power to enact labor, commercial, penal code, approval of\nfederal appointments submitted by the executive and the establishment of federal\ninstitutions. So, the reserve powers of states only apply after counting all powers of the federal\ngovernment distributed throughout the constitution. The Ethiopian constitution\nproviders neither a “necessary and proper clause”nor a comprehensive list of\nshared powers except for taxation. The constitution empowers the federal government to formulate and implement\nthe countries policies, strategies and plans in respect of overall economic, social\nand development matters, . . . establish and implement national standards and\nbasic policy criteria for public health, education, science and technology (art-\n51(2)(3))\nOne may state that this is perhaps more than “the proper and necessary clause”for\nit grants the federal government with wide powers on economic, social, health and\neducation aspects. The same constitution also empowers the states among other things to formulate\n39\nand execute economic social and development policies, strategies and plans for the\nstates. ( art -52(2)(c))\nThe big question is to “draw the border line”b/n the two, but certainly there is no\ndoubt that this makes most of the “policy making areas shared”. Despite some variations the common trend in federations is that allocation of\nresponsibilities has usually been based on the vague concept that matters of\nNational importance should be reserved to the cent5al government, while matters\nof regional importance should devolve to the states. But the principle does not tell\nus much about the specifics of what powers should go to the central government\nand which one to the states.

Shared legislative powers\nAlthough there is a division of exclusive powers in a federal system b/n the tiers of\ngovernment s, the dividing line b/n them is not clear. There are some deliberate and unintended overlaps in the division of power. Shared power represents the meeting point of the two levels of government s.\nThese powers refer to that category of power in which both the federation and the\nstates exercise at the same point of a power. Reasons why shared powers\n1) Experience has shown that there are certain matters which cannot be\nallocated exclusively either to the federal government or the states, it may\n40\nbe desirable that the states should legislate on some matters but it is also\nnecessary that the federal government should also legislate to enable it in\nsome cases to secure uniformity across the nation. 2) Another reason for heaving shared powers is the fact that the federal\ngovernment\nmay need to guide and encourage state efforts and more\nimportantly some measures taken by the states may have spill-over affects\nand for this reason the federal government may need to intervene. 3) Practical impossibility –shared power avoids the necessity of enumerating\ncomplicated minute subdivisions and it is necessary b/c there is practical\nimpossibility to have neatly divided the whole powers b/n the tiers of\ngovernment s.\n‘Conventionally’it is assumed that in case of conflict b/n regional and federal laws\nin the “shared powers”the federal laws shall always prevail to the extent state laws\ninconsistency. Regional governments have the primary constitutional responsibility on social\nservices. - Social services cover education, health protection and welfare of citizens,\ninsurance and assistance for old age, unemployment, accident and works of\ncompensation. - The personal nature of the service, the need to adapt them to local\ncircumstances\nand their close relationship to other aspects of local\ngovernment urge for state power. However, extensive federal assistance has\noften been necessary b/c of program costs and b/c of the pressure for federal\nwide standards of service to the citizen.",

In that\nelection, the two competitors had got equal votes (Jefferson and Bur). In situations,\nwhere the competent got equal votes the compress shall decide who should be\npresident and who vice president.

In February 17, 1801 Jefferson was made the winner but the handing over of\npresidential power is to be made in March 3 of the midnight. In 2 March 1801 the congress had approved the appointments of the 42 justices and\nin the mean time 39 of them were served with the letter of appointment. In three March 1801 the new president had taken office in the midnight. Then\nMadison was appointed the secretary of Jefferson who took the three letters of\nappointment yet not served, which after wards Madison refused to give the\ncommission as he is ordered to do so by President Jefferson. From the three justices who were not served with the commission, one was\nMarbury and as a result of this refusal he had instituted a petition to the Supreme\nCourt claiming the letter of appointment. Ultimately, though John marshal declined to order the secretary of the president\nfearing that this is purely political issue but his reason in the case was left as a\nbench mark to judicial review. Marshal has argued to the question whether the courts can nullify laws which\ncontradict the constitution. - He argued; the constitution is the will of the people and the legislation is the\nwill of the legislature hence the constitution shall be given paramount\nimportance.",

There are two\napproaches;\n- Original meaning\n- Original intent\nOriginalists argue that the constitution should be construed by the original\nunderstanding of the founders. A constitutional word is chosen carefully, and then\nthe meaning of words shall not be changed. They further say the constitution is the\ndecision of the people hence should not be changed by courts. But the critique is that the constitution shall not be confined to one period of\nunderstanding. This limits advancements in outlook. For instance, the understanding of cruel and inhuman treatment was so much\ndifferent if we look 100 or 200 years back slavery was not for example that much\ncruel but now a days it is. If we stick to the original understanding we are limiting the advancement of the\ncon. 3) Developmentalism –understands the constitution as an evolving document. For instance the understanding of “cruel and inhuman treatment was\nchanged from the 18th century understanding. Because during that time\nslavery was not considered as cruel and inhuman. Then this approach\nconsiders\nthe\nsocietal\nmoral development\nto construe\nconstitutional\ninterpretation. ® The criticism towards this approach is that the constitution would\n52\nunpredictable\nbecause\nthe\njudges\nwill\nconstrue\ntheir\nown\nunderstandings. ® The ‘silte’decision of the HOF is seen from developmental approach. Because the identify claim is not included in the constitution but the\nHOF\nby\ntaking\npossible\ndevelopments\nmade\na\nconvincing\nconstitutional interpretation. 4) Philosophical approach- this is an interpretation using moral, political and\nother sociological philosophies to serve or give meaning to the constitution. Philosophical approach is essential to solve conflicting theories or theories\nof law which have more than one interpretations. For instance, the issue of sovereignty, rule of law, majority rule etc are\nalways unsettled fluid issues which needs philosophical look. Therefore, controversial terms of\nthe con. Shall be seen from the\nphilosophical point of view so as to give constitutional meaning? 5) Systemic structuralism – this shares quite a good relationship with\ntextualism. Systemic structuralism says the constitutional text has systemic\nunity. The text of a constitution on aspires or serves the same end.

This stand was also the stand of the CCI, which excludes other laws and decisions. Whether art-84(2) is determinative of the powers of the HOF we should look at the\nconstitutional making history. - During the constitutional making the constitutional assembly argued that the\ncourt shall not have any role in constitutional disputes. During that time\nsome had suggested that individual rights to be interpreted by courts and\ngroup rights by the HOF. But letter on the over whelming argument was all\nconstitutional interpretation should be given to the HOF. Then the two\nproclamations are making operative the intentions of the law makers. - The caption of the article 84 says powers and functions of the CCI, it does\nnot say anything about the HOF. In terms of substantive functions of the council, art-84(1) is more important\nthan the subsequent sub articles. Then the power of the HOF should be construed rather on the basis of art-83(1) and\n62(1) of the constitution. Art-84(2) only puts small portions of constitutional interpretation i.e., it is very\nmuch procedural which says “what will happen if laws are contested by parties as\nbeing unconstitutional”\nSub art-3 is saying “issues of constitutional interpretation. Then this may include\nany issues which might be “issues beyond laws”. 57\nTherefore, art-84(2) is dealing with procedural issues (matters) on how to\nchallenge laws o the two levels of government legislatives. This shows that the\nprimacy given to legislative organs since they are recognized as the highest\nauthorities in their respective government (art 50(3)). The role of courts\nIf we say that the HOF has exclusive jurisdiction what would be the role of courts\nin relation to constitutional interpretation? Under art 13(1) the fact that the court is mentioned along with other organs of the\ngovernment. their power is not as such exaggerated. But from their role they are\norgans which will settle disputes by invoking even the constitutional provisions. Procn. 250/2001-has dealt to some extent the role of courts Art-21 and 22 of the\npron. deals with courts in relation to interpretation proper.

In the division of power vertical and horizontal division of power, powers\nare normally divided b/n the tiers of government s and among the legislature, the\nexecutive and the judiciary. Then this leads to dual set of courts. In which federal\ncourts applying and interpreting federal laws and the state courts interpreting state\nlaws. This structure is led by the general line of federal arrangement. The USA courts are\nexamples to this division. In this case each court interprets its own respective laws;\nfederal courts federal laws and state courts, state laws. Unlike the American case, the German system follows an integrated judicial\nsystem. All judicial power not given to federal courts is reserved to the state courts. This means most matters involving federal law are litigated initially in state courts\nsubject to federal appellate review. 60\nIn Germany all lower and intermediate courts of appeals are state courts, where as\ncourts of final appeals are federal courts. In this system the organization and operation of the judiciary is shared b/n the\nfederal and state courts. Therefore, there are not competing federal and state courts in countries that follow\nthe latter structure of courts. In Germany, the federal government legislates laws and state courts apply these\nlaws and finally there is federal Supreme Court with appellate jurisdiction at eh\napex of the judicial structure. When we see the Ethiopian case, the constitution stipulates that there are dual court\nsystems (50(2)) 78(3), 50(7). However, regarding the establishment of inferior\ncourts (except the Supreme Court) it reserves for the HPR to decide by a two third\nmajority vote as it deems necessary, nationwide or in some parts of the country.",

    "text": "(78(2))\nThere is only one federal Supreme Court with nationwide jurisdiction and until\nrecently the federal high court and federal first instance courts were limited to\nAddis Ababa and Dire dawa. If inferior courts are not established by the decision of the HPR, the constitution\nhas put a way out how the powers of these courts are implemented in state courts. This is through delegation.(78(20)\n80(2)(4)\nPowers of fede. First inst. Court\nstate high court\nPowers of fed. High court\nstate Supreme Court\nAnd in case of appeal, the delegated powers of state high court are appealable to\nstate Supreme Court however; the delegated powers of state Supreme Court are\nappealable to federal Supreme Court. But recently the parliament according to its power has decided to establish inferior\n61\nfederal courts in states excepting Amara, Tigray and Oromia. Then except in these\nregions a full-fledged dual court system is on its way however, in the three regions\nthe delegation is still to continue. Therefore, theoretically speaking, the Ethiopian judicial system is organized on a\ndual basis in which there are two parallel court systems with their own independent\nstructure and administration. However, until the enactment of the new law the operation of state and federal\ncourts was an integrated one. One reason for this was the lack of trained man\npower. Shared Judicial Powers? There are two arguments on whether there is concurrent judicial powers b/n the\nfederal and state government s? ® There are those who hold that the dual court structure is strictly taken both\nunder the constitution and the procn 15/1996. Then, they argue that civil and\ncriminal cases fall either before an exclusively state or federal courts. One\nindication of their argument is the fact that there are no powers listed to be\nshared b/n the tiers of government s in the 25/1996 proclamation. ® The other argument contents that despite the laws silence, there still remains\na concurrent judicial power. For instance,\n-\nLabor law (55(3))\n-\nCommercial law (55(4))\n-\nPenal code (55(5))\nWe know these laws are federal laws but they are not mentioned in the 25/96\nproclamation and hence should be among the shared powers.",

    "text": "Here my argument is different, as far as these laws are concerned the porcn 25/96\nthough not mentioned specifically, has tried to illustrate generally in its art-3(1) by\nstating cases arising under –“federal laws”and federal laws is defined in art-2(3)\n62\nthen how can we say that the law fails to mention them? However, it is true that these laws are not mentioned in the subsequent lists of\nfederal court jurisdictions but the question is whether such lists are exhaustive or\nenumerative? This will somehow solve the issue at hand regarding these and other\nfederal laws. Had the lists been intended to be exhaustive why the law needs to list out general\npowers under art 1, 2, and 3? If there is a federal law and a conflict arises on this law, there is no such heated\nargument as to which courts are best suited to enforce these laws through\ninterpretation. The federal courts are always there to enforce federal laws. On this point my\nargument is that yes federal court are there to interpret mainly of federal laws but I\nargue further that the procn illustrates specific powers of the federal courts and\nhence powers which are not\nlisted specifically may not show the exclusion of\nfederal courts from interpreting these laws. But shows that these powers are not\nexclusive powers of the federal government which means that these kinds of\npowers shall be exercised by both the federal and state courts, In this case there\nseems a shared judicial powers in our federations judicial structures. Besides if we read art-13(1) of the federal constitution and the respective state\nconstitutions; it is declared that all federal and state legislatures, executive and\njudicial organs at all levels shall have the responsibility and duty to respect and\nenforce the provisions of this chapter (3). This clause, if taken seriously has far reaching consequences as far as the role of\nthe judicially in enforcing and protecting human rights is concerned. Surprisingly however, when stating jurisdiction of federal courts under art-3(1) of\nthe procn 25/96 the law thought mentioned the constitution as one area of the\nfederal courts jurisdiction it does not state as to the powers of state courts. 63\nLikewise, though there is the general illustration of “federal laws”unless\nspecifically mentioned in the subsequent articles. It makes sense if we assume they\nare shared powers with the state courts. Further if we look at art-52(2)(a) the states are duty bound to enforce and protect\nthe federal constitution. Then the states are assumed to enfo4ce the constitution\nthrough their agents’one of which is the state courts.",

    "text": "Jurisdiction\nAs to the issue of jurisdiction; the con declares that judicial powers both at federal\nand state levels are vested in the courts. Moreover, the con states “everyone has a right to bring a justifiable matter to and\nobtain a decision and judgment by a court of law and other competent body with\njudicial power. This seems to define broadly the scope of judicial power. It\nsuggests that not all disputes are within the scope of judicial power. The constitution further states that the federal Supreme Court has the highest and\nfinal judicial klpower over federal matters and the state Supreme Court likewise on\nstate matters. But the question which is vaguely stated by the constitution is what federal matter\nis? Defining this seems key for allocating powers to federal and state courts at this\njuncture despite the existence of controversies on whether federal courts have\nexclusive judicial power on all federal mattes, proc. 25/1996 seems better in\ndefining specially what federal laws constitute. As can be seen the proclamation allocates subject matter jurisdiction to federal\ncourts on the basis of three grounds; laws, parties and places. “Federal laws”is given a very wide definition under art-2(3) of the 25/96\nproclamation. Accordingly, all laws enacted by virtue of article 55 of the federal\nconstitution by the HPR are federal laws. Besides all other laws enacted by\n64\nprevious regimes that are not repealed are also federal laws. The labor code, the\ncommercial code and the criminal code are then federal laws. While this is general clue as to what constitutes federal laws, the proclamation that\ndefines the civil and criminal jurisdiction of federal courts lists only a fraction of\noffences or cases to be adjudicated by federal courts. Then the question is what will happen to the powers which are not explicitly\nmentioned? Whether they are shared powers if so do state courts have jurisdiction to try federal\ncases as a result of this concurrency and can these cases be appealed before the\nfederal Supreme Court? If we assume that the state courts can handle federal cases form the above\ninterpretation the next question is whether this is a delegated power or shared\npower? The effect on appeal likewise is different. Constitutionally speaking as per art -80(1) the federal Supreme Court has final\nauthority on federal matters. Then in case of delegated power the federal Supreme\nCourt can have appellate jurisdiction on cases seen by the state supreme courts by\ndelegation. (",

    "text": "Art -80(6))\nWherever, if it is a case of shared power that falls on federal matters the state\nSupreme Court shall have the appellate power as per art -80(2). But the practice reveals that whether powers are exercised by state courts on the\ndelegated one or on the shared one there is no appeal except the cassation which\nemanates from fundamental error of law. ( art -80(3)(a)) Look the 25/96 procn on\nits art -9(appellate jurisdiction of the F. supreme court). The difference b/n delegated power and shared powers of regional courts? If we say shared power we are referring to procn 25/96 in which it lists exclusive\npowers of the federal courts. Then powers left from the “exclusive list”are deemed\nshared powers b/n the federal and state courts. However, when we say delegated\n65\npowers we are referring to those a “federal courts exclusive powers”but because of\ninconvenience delegated to the regional courts as per art -80(2)(4) of the\nconstitution. Except the power of cassation given to the federal supreme court, the Ethiopian\njudicial structure seems”a dual court structure”. But, the federal Supreme Court has power of cassation over all matters arisen in\nfederal and state courts. There is a counter argument for this power emanated from the principle of\nfederalism. Which states;\nWhen a matter is assigned to belong to a state jurisdiction it is based on the view\nthat the matter is local rather than of national importance. It is because it is felt that\nthe case allows for regional variation as opposed to uniformity. The review of\ncases by federal Supreme Court which are cases emanated from state laws is\ncontradictory to the idea of federalism. Because, through cassation the federal\ngovernment is intervening in the regions autonomous powers. The Supreme Court is using this power to guarantee a uniform interpretation of\nlaws across the states. From experiences of other federations uniformity is needed\nin some areas. However, this uniformly is limited to federal laws. This important\nqualification is missing in the Ethiopian situation. Emergency powers\nIn any country emergent powers may arise owing to various factors like war,\nrebellion, natural disaster etc. which call for immediate measure to be taken by the\ngovernment to safeguard the stability of the citizens. This kind of power is different from the normal system of administration rather is a\nspecial power which is designed to tackle the new situations. Most of the time emergency powers are seen in r/n to human rights.",

The purpose of the Criminal Code of the Federal Democratic Republic of \nEthiopia is to ensure order, peace and the security of the State, its \npeoples, and inhabitants for the public good. It aims at the prevention of crimes by giving due notice of the crimes \nand penalties prescribed by law and should this be ineffective by providing \nfor the punishment of criminals in order to deter them from committing \nanother crime and make them a lesson to others, or by providing for their \nreform and measures to prevent the commission of further crimes. Article 2.-  Principle of Legality. (1) Criminal law specifies the various crimes, and the penalties and \nmeasures applicable to criminals. (2) The Court may not treat as a crime and punish any act or omission \nwhich is not prohibited by law. The Court may not impose penalties or measures other than those \nprescribed by law. (3) The Court may not create crimes by analogy. (4) The above provisions shall not prevent the Court from interpreting the \nlaw. In cases of doubt the Court shall interpret the law according to its \nspirit, in accordance with the meaning intended by the legislature so as \nto achieve the purpose it has in view. 2\n(5) Nobody shall be tried or punished again for the same crime for which \nhe has been already convicted, punished or subjected to other \nmeasures or acquitted by a final decision in accordance with the law. Article 3.- Other Penal  Legislation. Nothing in this Code shall affect regulations and special laws of a criminal  \nnature: \n        Provided that the general principles embodied in this Code are \napplicable to those regulations and laws except as otherwise expressly \nprovided therein. Article 4.- Equality Before the Law. Criminal law applies to all alike without discrimination as regards persons, \nsocial conditions, race, nation, nationality, social origin, colour, sex, \nlanguage, religion, political or other opinion, property, birth or other status.",

During this period, radical political, economic and social \nchanges have taken place in Ethiopia. Among  the major changes are  \nthe recognition by the Constitution and international agreements \nratified by Ethiopia of the equality between religions, nations, \nnationalities and peoples,  the democratic rights and freedoms of \ncitizens and residents,  human rights, and most of all, the rights of \nsocial groups like women and children. After all these phenomena \nhave taken place,  it would be  inappropriate to allow the continuance \nof the enforcement of the 1949 Penal Code. Another discernible gap in the Penal Code is its failure to  \nproperly address crimes born of advances in technology and the \ncomplexities of modern life. The Penal Code does not incorporate \ncrimes such as the hijacking of aircraft, computer crimes and money \nlaundering. Besides, as regards crimes related to corruption and drugs \nalthough they are nowadays, attracting attention both in legislation \nand follow-up not only within national frontiers but also on the regional \nand international levels, due to the grave crises they are causing, the \nPenal code does not adequately deal with such crimes with the degree \nof seriousness they deserve. Another point that should not be overlooked is the Penal Code's \nfailure to acknowledge the grave injuries and sufferings caused to \nwomen and children by reason of harmful traditional practices. Surely, \nthe Constitution guarantees respect for the cultures of peoples, but it \ndoes not buttress up those practices scientifically proven to be \nharmful. It is also futile to issue a law that does not have the trust \nand support of the people for it usually remains impracticable.",

    "text": "But it \nis well recognized in the philosophy of criminal legislation that the \nlegislature should, by adopting progressive laws at times, educate and \nguide the public to dissociate  itself from harmful traditional practices. 328\nFurthermore, it is desirable to adopt a comprehensive code by \nassembling the various criminal provisions published in the Negarit \nGazeta in a disintegrated manner. Similarly, since the parallel \napplication, of the regular Penal Code and the Revised Special Penal \nCode in respect of similar matters disregards equality among citizens, \nthe existence of a comprehensive Criminal Code will put an end to \nsuch practice. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings and \nadopt a comprehensive Criminal Code, substantial activities have been \nundertaken throughout the entire Country. Discussions have been \nheld on the draft Criminal Code  prepared by the Ministry of Justice \nand the Justice and Legal System Research Institute. Legal and \nmedical professionals, psychiatrists, different institutions of higher \neducation and professional associations have made significant \ncontributions through the opinions they gave to the enactment of the \nlaw. Representatives of the people selected from different sectors and \nassociations have forwarded important views in discussion forums on \nthe draft laws conducted in Addis Ababa and the regions. It is mainly \non the basis of public opinion that punishments have increased in \nrespect of crimes like rape and aggravated theft. Moreover, the \nopinions of legal scholars and the laws and experiences of foreign \ncountries have been consulted to enrich the content of the Criminal \nCode. Finally, one point that must not be left unmentioned is the \nmatter concerning the determination of sentence. Since it is essential \nto facilitate the method by which Courts can pass similar punishments  \non similar cases, some major changes have been made in the \nprovisions of the Code. Provisions of the Penal Code that used to \nmake sentencing complicated and difficult have been amended. Provisions have been inserted which enable the Courts to pass the \nappropriate penalty for each case by carefully examining from the \nlightest to the most severe punishment. A sentencing manual will also \nbe issued to ensure and control the correctness and uniformity of \nsentencing. Another point which must be raised in connection with the  \ndetermination of sentence is that the purpose of Criminal Law is  to \npreserve the peace and security of society. It protects society by \npreventing the commission of crimes, and a major means of \npreventing the commission of crime is punishment.",

Although imprisonment and \ndeath are enforced in respect of certain crimes the main objective is  \ntemporarily or permanently to prevent wrongdoers from committing \nfurther crimes against society. And in such cases with the exception \nof the death sentence even criminals sentenced to life imprisonment \ncan be released on parole before serving the whole term;  in certain \ncrimes \nconvicts \ncan \nbe \nreleased \non \nprobation \nwithout \nthe \npronouncement of sentence or without the enforcement of the \nsentence pronounced. This helps wrongdoers to lead a peaceful life \nand it indicates the major place which the Criminal Law has allocated \nfor their rehabilitation. The fact that wrongdoers, instead of being made to suffer while in \nprison, take vocational training and participate in academic education, \nwhich would benefit them upon their release, reaffirms the great \nconcern the Criminal Code has for the reform of criminals. It must be noted that, by laying down in the  Code express provisions \nconcerning these cases, it is intended that Courts should, on passing \nsentence, take into account the purpose of the law and the different \naims of punishment. It is hoped that this Criminal Code, which has been revised through all \nthese persistent efforts, will ensure respect for the order,  peace and \nsecurity of the State and its peoples as well as respect for the rights \nand freedoms of its citizens and inhabitants. Being convinced that this Code will enable to accelerate the economic \nprogress of the State, that it will strengthen a steady order of free \nmarket and that it will, above all, contribute towards the promotion of \na fair judicial system, in our country,  pursuant to Article 55(1) of the \nConstitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia it is hereby \nproclaimed as follows:\n330\n1.

If so, what is Crime and criminal science?  “Crime” is an offence committed by an individual who is a basic unit of a society. Therefore, Criminal Science” is a social study. The main aims of Criminal Science are:\n To discover the causes of criminality,\n To devise the most effective methods of reducing the amount of criminality,\n To perfect the machinery for dealing with criminals. What are the main Branches of Criminal Science?  Based on these three objectives, three main branches of Criminal Science have developed. They are:\n1. Criminology:  concerned with causes of crimes and comprises of two different branches. 1.1. Criminal Biology:  This investigates causes of criminality, which may be found in the\nmental or physical constitution of the delinquent himself such as hereditary tendencies and\nphysical defects. 1.2. Criminal Sociology:  This deals with enquiries into the effects of environment as a cause\nof criminality, such as the objective factors like social, political and economic conditions\nleading to criminality, also termed as criminal anthropology. 2. Criminal Policy or Penology: deals with treatment, prevention and control of crimes and it\nmakes use of the information provided by Criminology. 3. Criminal Law: The Criminal Policies postulated by the above twin sister-branches i.e.\nCriminology and Penology, are implemented through the instrumentality of ‘Criminal law’. Criminal law in its wider sense consists of two branches. 3.1. Substantive Criminal Law: lays down the principles of criminal liability, defines\noffences and prescribes punishments for the same. Page | 2\n3.2. Adjective/Procedural Criminal law: it look after the process of the administration and\nenforcement of the substantive criminal law. What are the requirements to the efficient Criminal Law?  A body of special rules regulating human conduct promulgated by state and uniformly\napplicable to all classes to which it refers and is enforced by punishment.”",

    "text": "It means the\nwhole body of criminal law to be efficient must have four important elements;\na. Politically: implies that only the violations of rules made by the state are regarded as\ncrimes. b. Specificity; connotes that it strictly defines the act to be treated as crime. In other\nwords, the provisions of criminal law should be stated in specific terms. c. Uniformity: implies its uniform application to all alike without any discrimination, thus\nimparting even-handed justice to all alike. The idea is to eliminate judicial discretion in\nthe field of administration of criminal justice. d. Penal sanctions: imposed under the criminal law that the members of society are\ndeterred from committing crimes. It is, therefore, obvious that no law can be effective\nwithout adequate penal sanctions. What are the major purpose of criminal law in general?  The objectives of Criminal law are\na.  the protection of persons and property,\nb. the deterrence of criminal behavior,\nc. the punishment of criminal activity and\nd. Rehabilitation of the criminal. What are the major purpose and function of Ethiopian criminal law?  The specific purpose and function of Criminal Law are clearly stated in Art. 1 of the\nCriminal Code of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia;\n N.B. Function is thus a special activity or task while purpose is the ultimate objective to be\nachieved.   Therefore, it follows that the Criminal Code of Ethiopia endeavors to achieve the purpose of\n“ensuring order, peace and security of the state and its inhabitants for the public good”\nthrough declaration of forbidden conduct, providing for suitable punishment, reform of\ncriminals and preventive measures to control the commission of crimes. Page | 3\nWhat is wrong and morality?  A wrong is an act forbidden by the society or when Society prohibits certain activities basing\non the general conscience of the society, which is found in the values and norms of the\nsociety.  The concept of morality explains the values of a particular society. This means that a given\nsociety declares certain acts, which offend the moral conscience of that society as forbidden. Is the violation of all morality constitutes legal punishment?  Since all violations of morality cannot be characterized as crimes, there is a necessity to\nidentify the particular class of violations or forbidden acts or wrongs for the purpose of\ndefining what ‘crime’ is.",

    "text": " wrongs are classified in to two;\na. Legal Wrong: The wrongs prescribed by the criminal law and The state may respond to\nany of such acts in two different ways:\n Civil Wrong: Where the state takes action against the wrong-doer at the instance of\nthe injured party and\n Criminal Wrong: Where the state by itself proceeds against the wrong-doer, the\nwrong is referred to as criminal wrong. b. Moral Wrong:\nWhat is the Relation between Morality and Criminal Law?  Though morality and law can be precisely distinguished, they are not totally distinct\nphenomena.  They are related to each other in that they both aim at maintaining social order. There is a\ncategory of wrongs towards which law and morality react with common hatred. They are\noffences like murder, rape, arson, robbery, theft, etc. What are the basic concepts of Crimes?  There are no easy explanations for the phenomena collectively called crime. a. Crime is deceiving concept because it covers an enormous range of human behavior. b. Crime is multi-dimensional: it requires the efforts of all concerned organs\nc. To common man crimes are those acts which people in society “consider worthy of\nserious condemnation”. Therefore, crime is an act which both forbidden by law and the\nmoral sentiments of the society. Page | 4\nN.B. To understand this explanation of Penal law three questions have to be answered:\n What kind of conduct is ‘forbidden’? ( Is not a static one; it changes with the change of social\nnorms and the notion about crime also changes with time)\n What kind of ‘formal social condemnation’ is considered appropriate to prevent such\nconduct?  What kinds of ‘sanctions' are considered as best calculated to prevent officially out lawed\nconduct? What is Crime?  The word “Crime” was originally taken from a Latin term “Crimen” which means “to\ncharge”. The Greek expression “Krimos” is synonymous to a Sanskrit word ‘Krama’ which\nmeans “Social order”.  Therefore, in common parlance the word crime is applied to those acts that go against social\norder and are worthy of serious condemnation.  Though there is no precise definition for crime, we can still have an understanding of the\nword by examining different definitions put forward by different jurists. a. Crime is a “Public Wrong”—Blackstone: is “an act committed or omitted in violation of a\npublic law either forbidding or commanding it”.",

    "text": "However, Blackstone’s definition fails to\ndefine crime satisfactorily. There is yet another accepted meaning of public law given by Kenny, (year) According to\nhim, public law means all “positive law” or “municipal law” which means “any law made\nby the state”. Blackstone modified definition and said, “A crime is a violation of the public rights and\nduties due to the whole community, considered as a community in its social aggregate\ncapacity”. In addition to that Stephen, while editing Blackstone’s Commentaries committed further\nerror as he slightly modified the definition and reconstructed it in the following words: “A\ncrime is a violation of a right, considered in reference to the evil tendency of such violation\nas regards the community at large.” Critics: Stephen (year) committed two errors in modifying Blackstone’s second definition:\nHe dropped the word ‘duties’ from Blackstone’s and the expression evil tendency of such\nviolation as regards the community at large. It means that crimes are breaches of those\nPage | 5\nlaws, which injure the community. However, all the acts that are injurious to the\ncommunity are not necessarily crimes. b. CRIME is A “Moral wrong” – Stephen: is “an act forbidden by law and which is at the\nsame time revolting to the moral sentiments of the society”. Defining crime, as something\nagainst the moral sentiments cannot be accepted because there are acts though not immoral,\nclassified as highly criminal, e.g., Treason i.e.  ‘Anything done to displace the governing\nbody of state.’ c. Crime is A “Procedural Wrong” –John Austin:  “A wrong which is pursued by the\nsovereign or his subordinates is a crime. A wrong which is pursued at the discretion of the\ninjured party and his representatives is a civil injury”. Critics: The definition does not\nexplain a number of crimes under the Criminal Code in which the prosecution could be\ninitiated only at the instance of injured party as is done in the case of civil wrongs\nd. Crime is a “Creation of Government Policy”: Kenny (year) opined that, so long as crimes\ncontinue to be created by the government policy, it was difficult to give a true definition of\nthe nature of crime. According to him “Crime” has the following three characteristics:\ni. A crime is a harm brought about by human conduct, which the sovereign power in the\nstate desires to prevent,\nii.",

Legal proceedings of special kind (criminal proceedings) are employed to decide whether\nthe person accused did in fact cause the harm and is according to law to be held legally\npunishable for doing so. e. Crime Is A “Legal Wrong”: Since no satisfactory definition of crime acceptable and\napplicable to all situations could be derived, penal statutes define, specifically, different\ncriminal behaviors, which they purport to check. Even the Criminal Code of FDRE, 2005,\nwhich has codified the great bulk of the criminal law of the country, does not give any\nstandard definition of crime. (See Art. 23(1). What are the distinguishing features of a ‘Crime’ Distinguished from ‘Civil Wrongs? The major features are:\nA. Nature of wrong: Crime is a public wrong i.e. a harm done against the society. A ‘tort’\nis a private wrong committed against an individual generally or the public in a given\nlocality. Page | 6\nB. Nature of the Right Violated: In a crime and a tort there is a breach of ‘right in rem’\nwhereas in a breach of contract there is breach of ‘right in personum’. C. Origin and Nature of the Duty: In a crime the duty not to cause harm is fixed by the\nstate. In tort such Duty is fixed generally by the operation of law where the law of non-\ncontractual liability remains un-codified and by the state where it has been incorporated\nin codified law (Art.2035ECC). In case of contract the duty limited to the parties. D. Consent of the Victim: Consent of the victim to the injury caused is a qualified defense\nin criminal law. ( Art 70 Criminal Code). In torts, consent of the plaintiff to the alleged\ninjury nullifies right to remedies. E. The Element of Intention: Intention is an essential element of crime (Art.57 and 58 of\nCriminal Code). Intention may form one of the ingredients of tort but not an essential\nprecondition for the Tortious liability. In an action for breach of contract whether the\nbreach   was intentional, is an irrelevant question. F. The Element of Negligence: Negligence attended with criminal lack of foresight\namounts to a crime (Art.59 Criminal Code). Mere negligence may amount to a tort\n(Art.2029 ECC). There is no question of negligence in an action for breach of the\nobligation arising out of a contract.",

Motive is taken into consideration in deciding tortious\nliability. Motive is irrelevant (1717 ECC) in an action for breach of contract. A breach is\na breach with whatever motive it was committed. H. Initiation of Legal Proceedings: Criminal proceedings are conducted in the name of the\nstate. The state steps into the shoes of the victim as the protector of interests of its\ninhabitants. In case of the other two civil wrongs, it is the injured party that brings the\naction against the wrong-doer. I. Remedies Available:  The punishments may range from fine, compensation through\nimprisonment of different kinds to capital punishment.

Purpose of Criminal Law and Objectives of Punishment Redefined:\nHow the crimes are classified under Ethiopian Criminal Code?  Generally, offences may be classified based on two criteria:\na. Classification based on the “Seriousness of the Crimes” The Criminal Code of FDRE has\nnot adopted a ‘tripartite’ distinction but simply classifies crimes into various titles on the\nbasis of content rather than on the scale of punishment. The three variations in the\ndeprivation of liberty , namely, ‘rigorous imprisonment’, ‘simple imprisonment’ and ‘arrest’\napparently  denote a de facto classification into ‘very serious crimes’, ‘not very serious\ncrimes, and ‘petty offences’. b.  Classification based on the “Subject matter” of the Crime. the criminal code provides in\nthe following manner;\ni. Interests of the ‘State’: Crimes against state or against National or international\ninterests, Arts. 237-374. ii. Interests of the ‘Community’: Crimes against the Public Interests or the Community\nArts.378 – 537. iii. Interests of the ‘Individual’: Crimes against the individuals and the Family Arts.538-733. N.B. ‘tripartite’ distinction: it involves;\na. Treasons are anything done in the nature of an attempt to displace the governing body is\nclassed as Treason. It is a breach of duty of allegiance to the sate. b. ‘Felony’ is a serious criminal offence punishable by at least one year imprisonment\nc. ‘Misdemeanor’ is a criminal offence which is less serious than a felony, and is usually\npunishable by no more than a year\nPage | 9\nUNIT -II\nBASIC PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW\nWhat are the major principles of criminal law?  The most important criminal principles embodied in our Criminal code, specifically, are the\nfollowing:\n1.",

    "text": "The Principle of Legality (Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali)\n A Latin term and maxim Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali meaning, No\ncrime (can be committed), no punishment (can be imposed) without (having been prescribed\nby) a previous penal law).  This maxim states that there can be no crime committed, and no punishment meted out,\nwithout a violation of penal law as it existed at the time. Another consequence of this\nprinciple is that only those penalties that had already been established for the offence in the\ntime when it was committed can be imposed.  This principle first became prominent at the time of the French Revolution towards the end\nof the eighteenth century.  The principle of legality was a specific reaction against this repressive device, intended to\nend its use by requiring the government to announce in advance the rules of conduct it\nwould enforce by criminal law.  Thus, the conduct must be deemed a crime before the act is committed. The policy behind the\nprinciple of legality is that “fair warning” should be provided to a criminal so that he does\nnot inadvertently commit a crime that he has no reason to believe is illegal. Does the principle of legality constitute the rule of lenity?  The rule of lenity is a corollary to the principle of legality - it follows naturally from it. The\nrule of lenity requires that all ambiguities in statutory language be resolved in the defendant’s\nfavor.  The policy reasons are the same as the rule of legality. Also, the rule of lenity encourages the\nlegislature to write more clear statutes. What is the legal status of legality in Ethiopia?  Art. 2 of the Ethiopian Penal Code incorporate this principle. The principle, according to this\nprovision, has three important ingredients:\na. “nullum crimen sine lege” - No crime unless specified by law, (Art. 2/1)\nPage | 10\nb. “nulla poena sine lege” - No penalties other than prescribed by law, (Art. 2/2)\nc. “non bis in idem” – Nobody shall be punished twice for the same act, (Art. 2/5)\nA. ‘nullum crimen sine lege\nWhat is ‘nullum crimen sine lege?  The first ingredient of the principle of legality is that “there are no offences other than those\nwhich are expressly provided by law”.",

    "text": " ‘Criminal Law’ within the meaning of Art.2 is not only the Penal Code, but any law duly\npassed and published, which contains penal Provisions.  The principle “nullum crimen” conveys four different rules, namely:\ni. \nCertainty in Legislation: Certainty in legislation does not only mean that crimes should\nbe created by law but it also means that a prohibition must also be drafted in clear,\ncertain and unambiguous language. ii. Accessibility of the law: The Penal law must be accessible and intelligible because it is\naddressed to people in society who are bound to obey it on pain of punishment. iii. Rule of strict Construction, ‘Penal statutes must be constructed strictly’. Since all penal\nlaws affect the liberty of the subject, they have to be constructed strictly. Thus;\n The court must see that the act or omission charged as a crime is within the plain\nmeaning of the words used in the provision making that act or omission a crime.  The court must not strain the words used in defining a crime on any account; such as to\nprovide for an omission (i.e., casus omissus) or a slip nor can the court extend the\nmeaning of Criminal Statues by construction.  Full effect is to be given to every word used in the statute.  “No case shall fall within a penal statute which does not satisfy all the elements of the\ncrime as defined by the statute.”  The rule requires that where the ambiguous language of a statute leaves a reasonable\ndoubt about its meaning and scope, the benefit must go in favor of the accused. iv. No retroactive effect of criminal law: ‘no person shall be punished except in pursuance\nof a statute which fixes a penalty for a criminal conduct. It means there can be no ex-\npost facto Criminal law or in other words, the Criminal laws should not have\nretrospective operation. Is analogy is possible under criminal laws? Page | 11\n ‘nullum Crimen’ prohibits analogical extension of Penal statutes:\n According to ‘nullum crimen,’ as embodied in Art 2/1, primarily, courts cannot punish acts\nor omissions which are not prohibited by law.  To give further effect to this principle, there is a “prohibition of analogy” inserted by Art 2/3,\nwhich states – “The court may not create crimes by analogy”.",

    "text": "This means courts are not\nfree to punish an act on the basis of similarity in its evil nature to that of a punishable act. Since the principle of legality requires ‘a legal provision specifically forbidding the conduct’\nin question to attach criminal liability. What is the legal status of the Principle of Strict Interpretation in Ethiopia?  Under art (Art. 2/4) of the criminal code the duty not to depart from what the law prescribes\nfor the purpose of creating new crimes does not preclude courts from interpreting the law if\nthis is found necessary.   As long as the courts take due precaution not to create crimes by analogy, they are\nempowered by Art 2/4 to interpret the law in cases of doubt. However, this provision sets\nout specific conditions to ensure that they do not misuse such power; for not every legal\nprovision is open to construction, nor should construction take place in disregard of\ncertain basic rules. If so, what should be consider in the interpretation of the criminal law?  Interpretation may be considered only in legitimate instances such as the following:\ni. \nIn cases of ambiguity (unclear) of the law, i.e. when the law contains provisions which\nare on the face of them inconsistent (contradictory), or\nii. Where, by reason of the language used, a provision is of such an uncertain or obscure\nmeaning that its true sense is doubtful. Which methods the court shall use for interpretation?  Where a doubt arises as to the meaning or the scope of the legal provision, the court which\ninterprets such provision must have regard to “the meaning intended by the legislature”. To\nthis end, he proposes the following two methods of interpretation:\n Grammatical or logical interpretation, in which the meaning is sought from  within the\ntext of the law, or\n Historical interpretation, in this method the meaning may be sought from without the\ntext of the law. Looking the drafting history. Page | 12\n In either of the cases, the court should bear in mind the general purposes of the law as\ndefined in Art 1 and the particular purposes of the provision calling for interpretation.

    "text": " According to Art 2 This principle forbids double jeopardy, as enshrined in Art 23 of our\nConstitution.  The doctrine of double jeopardy means that no person can be tried or punished more than\nonce for the same crime. This is an important principle of the administration of criminal\njustice.  The rule is contained in the common law maxim “autrefois acquit and autrefois convict”\nwhich means “the previous acquittal or previous conviction may be pleaded by the accused\nas a bar to the subsequent trial”. Is the principle of double jeopardy applies to several punishments for the same offense?  It should, however, be noted that a single sentence may embody more than one items of\npunishment (e.g. Imprisonment and payment of fine). Thus, he may not allege that he is\nbeing punished more than once.  If punishments are for different crimes then there is no double jeopardy protection. Double jeopardy can be put into effect only in cases where the crimes have same elements. When the jeopardy begins?  \"Jeopardy\" begins with framing of charges and ends with a suitably error-free judgment. 2. The Principle Of Equality\nThe principle of equality originated in the process of the development of Roman law governed\nby ‘jus civile’ (Civil Law). And ‘jus gentium’ (law of the nations) to rule the peoples they\nconquered. Page | 14\nWhat are the major elements of the principle of equality?  All men are born equal and must be treated equally. These constitutional guarantees of\nequality take a great number of forms but two of the formulations are most often used. They\nare:\na.  Equality Before The Law: subjection\n A number of distinct meanings are normally given to the provision that there should be\nequality before the law. One meaning is that, equality before the law only connotes the equal\nsubjection of all to a common system of law whatever it’s content. . b. The Equal Protection Of Laws: treatment\n It is a more positive concept implying equality of treatment in equal circumstances. This\nexpression is exclusively associated with written constitutions and embodies guarantees of\nequal treatment normally applied not only to the procedural enforcement of laws but also to\nthe substantive content of their provisions.  In other words, the equal protection of the laws is invariably treated as a substantive\nconstitutional principle, which demands that laws will only be legitimate if they can be\ndescribed as just and equal.",

What is the legal status of the principle of equality in Ethiopia?  Article 4 of the Criminal Code and art 25 of FDRE constitution.  Precisely, the principle, as applicable to criminal field, means two things:\ni. \nthat all individuals may claim the same legal protection if they have been injured by  a\ncrime, and\nii. that all persons who have come into conflict with the law must be treated equally and\ntried exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the law they have infringed,\nwithout discrimination of any kind.

Is it an absolute immunity?  In fact this is not an absolute immunity, properly speaking, as it is immunity from\nprosecution in Ethiopia only. Foreign diplomats who violate the laws of Ethiopia are not\npunishable in Ethiopia under Ethiopian law, but they are naturally liable to prosecution and\npunishment in their own country under their national law. What are the remedies available for the gross violations by immune persons?  Prosecution may be conditional upon the fulfillment of certain requirements. Normally, if a\nperson enjoying diplomatic immunity grossly offends or misuses his office or does an act\ndetrimental to the country, the remedy is to make a demand of his recall by the sending\nstate, where appropriate action may be taken against him at the discretion of the sovereign\nwhom he represents. What is the effects of diplomatic immunity?  The effect of diplomatic immunity is then merely to create an exception to the general\nprinciple of the territorial application of the law, as the criminal is not punishable at the\nplace where he committed the crime under the law which he violated (Arts 11(2) of EPC and\nArt.",

Ambassadors and Diplomats: Ambassadors, their families, secretaries, messengers and\nservants also enjoy the same immunity as the sovereign or the state which they represent.

Requirements of Individualization of Criminal Justice:\n Art. 88(2) of the Criminal Code, incorporates the fundamental principle that, 'the penalty\nshall be determined according to the degree of individual guilt’, having regard to all the\ncircumstances of the case and not only to the material seriousness of the crime.",

IV. Special Treatment of Women, Young Persons and the Feeble Minded:\n The expressions ‘special circumstances of the criminal’ and ‘age of the criminal’ used in the\nsecond paragraph of Article.4 make room for differential treatment of women, children and\nthe mentally abnormal criminals.  In case of women, the biological factors sometimes pose a serious concern while applying\nthe law uniformly. See art Article 119 and 120 (1); 110(1),\nPage | 17\n Similarly, the juvenile delinquents and the young criminals are given a special treatment\nunder the Criminal Code due to the fact that this group of criminals is immature in their\nunderstanding and that they fall an easy prey for the bad influence of others.  To achieve this objective more effectively the Criminal Code puts the young criminals under\nthree categories. a. The infants i.e. children under the age of ‘9 years’ are deemed to be not criminally\nresponsible and therefore, are not punishable under the Code (Art. 52). The Code\nsuggests that appropriate steps to correct them may be taken by the family, school or\nguardianship authority. b. ‘The young persons: The children between 9 and 15 under Art. 53. Children of this age\ngroup are exposed to criminal liability but the Criminal Law deals with them with more\ncare and caution so as to ensure that they are not put to unnecessary rigor of the\npunishments designed for the mature individuals. Thus, the Criminal has Code devised\nspecial types of treatments that best suit the objectives of correction, reformation and\nrehabilitation. ( See Articles 157-168). c. Transitory age: The third group of young criminals, as per Art 56 falls between 15 and\n18 years. In criminal law 15 years is the age of full responsibility and they can be tried\nunder the ordinary provisions of the Code. However, preference shall be given to their\ntreatment with the special measure designed for the young criminals unless they appear to\nbe incorrigible or of dangerous disposition.  Feeble minded people are the other group of criminals who deserve special treatment.",

See Articles 129-131. C. The Principle Of Individual Autonomy:\n The principle of individual autonomy is that each individual should be treated as\nresponsible for his or her own behavior. This principle has factual and normative elements\nthat must be explored. What is the factual elements of autonomy?  The factual element in autonomy is that individuals in general have the capacity and\nsufficient free will to make meaningful choices. Page | 18\n The capacities assumed by the law may not be present in those who are too young or who are\nmentally disordered. These capacities relate to what are known as ‘preconditions of criminal\nliability’.   Preconditions refer to the ability to participate in a trial as a communicative enterprise. The\ngeneral assumption is thus that sane adults may properly be held liable for their conduct and\nfor matters within their control, except in so far as they can point to some excuse for their\n…for example, duress, mistake, or even social deprivation. What is The Normative Element of Autonomy?  That the individuals should be respected and treated as agents capable of choosing their\nacts and omissions, and that without recognizing individuals as capable of independent\nagency they could hardly be recognized as moral persons.  A major part the principle’s emphasis is that the individuals should be protected from\nofficial censure, through the criminal law, unless they can be shown to have chosen the\nconduct for which they are being held liable.  An individual should not be held criminally liable unless he had the capacity and fair\nopportunity to do otherwise.  If autonomy is to be respected, the State should leave individuals to decide for\nthemselves and should not take decisions ‘in their best interests’. ( Prohibit paternalistic\ncriminalization). What are the Instances which can raise Dilemmas Relating to the Principle of Autonomy? a. Euthanasia: Your Body, Your Death, Your Choice? The word euthanasia stems from the\nGreek words, “euthanatos” meaning “good death” and refers to the action of a third party,\nusually a doctor to deliberately end the life of an individual. The individual must give\nconsent for the procedure, which is known as voluntary euthanasia.",

In\nb. The Principle of Double Effect: if a patient is in severe pain, a doctor may prescribe pain\nmedication, the intention of which is to ease the patient’s suffering. However, in some cases\nthe dose of pain medication required to relieve the pain may also be sufficient to end that\nPage | 19\npatient’s life. This is known as the doctrine of double effect since the treatment provided\nto ease pain has the additional effect of ending the patient’s life. Does an individual have the Right to Choose How and When to Die?  It is generally accepted that as an expression of autonomy i.e. one’s right to make\nindependent choices without any external influences. However, when it comes to actively\nending a life via euthanasia there is widespread debate regarding the rights of an individual to\nmake that choice. a. Proponents argue that euthanasia allows terminally ill people to die with dignity and\nwithout pain and state that society should permit people to opt for euthanasia if they so\nwish. Proponents also state that individuals should be free to dictate the time and place of\ntheir own death. Finally, they argue that forcing people to live against their wishes\nviolates personal freedoms and human rights and that it is immoral to compel people to\ncontinue to live with unbearable pain and suffering. b. Opponents of euthanasia, on religious grounds, argue that life is a gift from God and\nthat only God has the power to take it away. Others contend that individuals donnot get to\ndecide when and how they are born, therefore, they should not be allowed to decide how\nand when they die. UNIT-III\nJURISDICTION OF THE ETHIOPIAN CRIMINAL CODE\n(Arts 11-22 of the Criminal Code of FDRE, 2005)\nWhat is jurisdiction?  Jurisdiction’ refers to particular aspects of the general competence of states often referred to\nas ‘sovereignty’. Jurisdiction is an aspect of sovereignty and refers to judicial, legislative,\nand administrative competence. a. The ‘prescriptive or legislative jurisdiction’ refers to the power to make decisions or\nrules. b. ‘The enforcement or prerogative jurisdiction refers to the power to take executive\naction in pursuance of or consequent on the making of decision and rules. c. Judicial Jurisdiction’: “the legal competence of a particular court to hear a certain type\nor class of cases”.",

Page | 20\nWhat is the meaning of jurisdiction under the criminal law?  The provisions of the Criminal Code relating to jurisdiction are intended to determine the\nscope of application of Ethiopian Criminal Law by Ethiopian Courts and to prevent\nconflicts of jurisdiction. When the conflict of jurisdictions are arise and what are their types?  The conflicts of jurisdiction might arise when the courts of two or more places decline to try\na crime, or when the courts of two or more places claim to have jurisdiction to try one and\nthe same crime.  These conflicts in jurisdiction may be of two kinds:\na. ‘Negative’ conflict of Jurisdiction: It may arise when different courts deny the existence\nof jurisdiction, over the matter in question. In this case there is the possibility of a\ncriminal escaping punishment. b. ‘Positive’ conflict of Jurisdiction: When different courts claim to have jurisdiction on\nthe same crime, there is a risk that the criminal might be exposed to “double jeopardy”. In which levels the conflict of jurisdictions may arise?  The conflicts of jurisdiction might arise at different levels:\na. Conflicts of Jurisdiction at National level: Such conflicts may arise as between\nEthiopian Criminal courts, which shall be settled in accordance with Arts 99-107 of the\nCriminal Procedure Code. b. Conflicts of Jurisdiction at International level:  These conflicts arise between an\nEthiopian court and a foreign court, which can be settled in accordance with Arts 11-22\nof the Criminal Code. What are the Fundamental Principles of Application of Jurisdiction? The major principles are:\na. The Principle of Territoriality:  The principle that the courts of the place where the crime\nis committed may exercise jurisdiction has received universal recognition. This principle\nhas a number of practical advantages, including the convenience of the forum and\npresumed involvement of the interests of the state where the crime is committed. According to this principle all crimes committed on Ethiopian territory fall within the\njurisdiction of Ethiopian Courts (Art. 11);\nPage | 21\nb. The Principle of Quasi-Territoriality or the Protective or Security Principle: Nearly all\nstates assume jurisdiction over aliens for acts done abroad which affect the security of the\nstate, a concept which takes in a variety of political crimes, but is not necessarily confined\nto political acts.",

Why we call it principal jurisdiction?  The effect of these courts having principal jurisdiction is that they are entitled to try a\ncriminal even though he may also be or has already been tried in a foreign country for the\nsame offence. What are the major types of principal jurisdiction?  The principal jurisdiction of the EPC is applicable both territorially and extra-territorially. A. Territorial Application of The Principal Jurisdiction\nI. Crimes Committed on Ethiopian Territory: Art.11   ‘Normal Case’\n Within the meaning of Art. 11 when a crime is committed within the territory of Ethiopia, the\ncode shall apply and the courts can try and punish irrespective of the fact that the person who\nhad committed the crime is an Ethiopian national or a foreigner. This is known as “territorial\njurisdiction”\n Because submission to the jurisdiction of the court is by virtue of the crime being\ncommitted within the Ethiopian territory. Here the jurisdiction attaches with territory. What are the major conditions to apply territorial jurisdictions?  For the territorial application of jurisdiction three conditions have to be fulfilled:\na. Crime committed by any person: The words any person under Art. 11 mean and\ninclude a citizen of Ethiopia as well as a non-citizen. Thus, any foreigner who enters the\nEthiopian territories accepts the protection of Ethiopian laws, and submits to the\noperation of the laws and to the jurisdiction of the Ethiopian courts.

The crime must have been committed on the Ethiopian territory: This essential\ncondition may be understood in the light of Art. 25(1) of the Criminal Code.

Within the meaning of this provision, the\ncrime must have been committed in any one of the following places:\n On the “land”:  The land part of Ethiopia can be identified by the provisions of Art. 2 of\nConstitution of Ethiopia. Moreover, by virtue of Art 104 of Criminal Procedure Code. The following places are deemed to form part of the Ethiopian territory i.e.:\no Ethiopian embassies abroad,\no Ships, flying Ethiopian flag, and\no Aircrafts flying Ethiopian flag. o Ships” belonging to the country whose national flag she is flying”.  In the “air”: According to International Conventions of 1919 and 1944, “air” i.e., the\natmosphere above the land area of a country forms part of the National Territory of that\ncountry.  Bodies of Water: the vessels sailing in such waters are triable by the criminal Courts of\nEthiopia. Page | 24\nN.B. Men of War of a state on foreign waters are exempted from the jurisdiction of the state\nwithin whose territorial jurisdiction they are.

II. Crimes by Foreigners on the Ethiopian Territory Art. 12 “Special Case”:\n These cases relate to crimes committed by foreigners on Ethiopian Territory. However,\ncertain practical impossibilities might arise if the ‘criminal-foreigner’ flees and takes\nrefuge in his country of origin. Art 12 deals with such problems:\n it is when\na. Impossibility to “try” the accused-Foreigner in Ethiopia Sub-Art. ( 1)   Of Art 12:  If his\nextradition cannot be obtained in accordance with Art 11(3), the Ethiopian authorities shall\nrequest that he be tried in the country of refuge.

What is the Effect of Foreign Sentences?  The concept of ‘Principal Jurisdiction’ seems to imply that Ethiopian courts may try a\ncriminal even though he has already been tried in a foreign country. So, in all the cases\nPage | 28\ncovered by the principal jurisdiction i.e. Arts 11, 13, 14 (1) and 15(2) a new trial is possible\nin Ethiopia, regardless of the fact the criminal might already have been tried for the same\ncrime.  This is apparently, contrary to Art. 23 of the Constitution and Art 2(5) of the Criminal Code\nsince the principle of ‘non bis in idem’ prohibits not only a person being punished twice for\nthe same crime but also being tried twice.

The Ethiopian Courts are not bound by a judgment of acquittal passed by a foreign\ncourt.  The same is true for the proceedings that has been instituted abroad but has been\ndiscontinued or where the accused has been discharged. This clearly contradicts Art. 23 of\nthe Constitution and Art 2(5) of the Criminal Code as they categorically say that ‘acquittal’\nalso is a bar to a second trial, without any qualification. What is Effect of ‘Conviction’ in a Foreign Court? Art. 16(3):\n Where the criminal was tried and sentenced abroad, and served all or part of the sentence, the\nrule against double jeopardy demands that the term of sentence served in the foreign country\nbe deducted from the sentence imposed in Ethiopia. Therefore, the court which tries him in\nEthiopia must have regard to the sentence passed abroad.  The deduction prescribed by Art. 16(3) must be affected only in so far as the criminal is\nconvicted in Ethiopia of the same crime as that with respect to which the foreign sentence\nwas passed. 2.

Why extradition is requested?  The following rational considerations have conditioned the law and practice as to extradition:\no To ensure that serious crimes do not go unpunished:  to close the net round such\nfugitive criminals, international law applies the maxim, ‘aut punire aut dedere’ i.e. the\noffender must be punished by the state of refuge or surrendered to the state which can and\nwill punish him. o Since the state on whose territory the crime has been committed is best able to try the\ncriminal because the evidence is more freely available there, and that state has the\nPage | 30\ngreatest interest in the punishment of the criminal, and the greatest facilities for\nascertaining the truth. o With the increasing rapidity and facility of international transport and\ncommunications, extradition began to assume prominence\nWhat is the status of extradition under international law?",

Extradition under the Criminal Code of FDRE, 2004, Art.21:\nHow the Extradition of a “Foreigner” is taken place? Art. 21(1):\n Any foreigner who commits an ordinary crime (i.e. non-political) outside the territory of\nEthiopia and takes refuge in Ethiopia may be extradited in accordance with the provisions of\nthe law, treaties or international custom.  However, it should be noted that if the crime with which the foreigner is accused of, falls\nunder the scope of Art. 13 he may not be extradited. Ethiopia retains its right to prosecute\nhim under its principal jurisdiction as the crime directly and principally concerns her. How Extradition of “Ethiopians” is taken place? Art. 21 (2):\n An Ethiopian national cannot be extradited to a foreign country. Page | 32\n However when such denial to surrender is made, he shall be tried by Ethiopian courts and\nunder Ethiopia law. This article endeavors to protect the Ethiopian nationals from foreign\njurisdictions in the following ways:\no If the accused has the status of an Ethiopian national at the time of commission of\nthe crime, even if he ceases to be an Ethiopian thereafter, he shall still fall within the\nscope of this provision. o An accused shall be governed by this provision provided he becomes an Ethiopian\nby the time of request for extradition, though at the time of commission of the crime\nhe was not an Ethiopian national. What are the Procedure to request for Extradition? ( Art. 21/1 and 3)\n Extradition shall be granted on the application made in proper form by the state where the\ncrime was committed provided; the crime does not directly and principally concern the\nEthiopian state (Art. 13).  Art. 21 (3) lays down that where a crime raises a question of extradition the requisition shall\nbe dealt with in accordance with the principles of Ethiopian law and provisions of existing\ntreaties.",

A harm\nbrought about by evil conduct manifests the evil mind behind it. Until then the guilty mind\nremains hidden in man’s thought and it is impossible to detect the evil intentions of a man.  Moreover, simply having an evil intention does not make a man punishable unless it ends in\na harmful result. Therefore, actus reus is such a result of human conduct as the law seeks to\nprevent. A.  The Legal Element of Crime:\n Refers to the infringement of any law, which is a criminal nature. This, in other words, means\nthat a law must exist and this law must be violated so as to hold a person criminally liable.

If so, which activities constitute actus reus? Page | 35\n There are four categories of harmful events resulting from active conduct, of which only one\ncategory comes under the expression of actus reus. a.

However, the\nexpression omission does not connote any obligation.  Under the criminal law, only failures to perform legal duties can amount to criminal\nomissions. Legal duties to act might arise out of relationships or contracts, or might be\nimposed by statutes. However, failures to perform moral duties cannot constitute the actus\nreus. Why only the failure to perform legal duties are constitute actus reus?  It is based on the proposition that the individual conscience, peer group pressure and other\ninformal compulsion regulates behavior more effectively than direct criminal prosecutions. Also, it would not only be burdensome but also impossible for the criminal justice system to\nenforce moral obligations.  A crime, according to Art 23/1, is also committed when a person fails to perform an act the\nperformance of which is prescribed by law.",

The ‘Moral Ingredients’ of Crime (Mens Rea)\n This has got something to do with the guilty state of mind of a person which is associated\nwith the principle “Nulla poena, sine culpa” which means there is no punishment without\nguilt.  This implies that a person cannot be held criminally liable for those acts he/she commits\nwithout there being any fault what so ever on his or her part unless there exists some sort\nof blameworthiness. The very principle of this element is provided under Article 57 of the\nCriminal Code.  According to this Article, Guilt, is an essential factor in determining whether a crime has\nbeen committed. The perpetrator should be held criminally liable and be punished if he or she\nacts in a blameworthy manner.  According to Art. 23 of the Criminal Code, any crime comprises legal, material and moral\ningredients, all of which must be present so that the crime may be deemed to have been\ncompleted.  The provisions of Arts. 57-67 dealing with ‘Criminal Guilt’ define this moral ingredient\ni.e. the state of mind of the criminal at the time of committing the unlawful act. Although\nthere is a legal presumption that every accused is responsible for his acts, there is no\npresumption that every responsible accused is guilty.  The important principle of criminal law that requires proof of guilt before attaching criminal\nliability to a person is recognized by the Constitution under Art. 20(3)\nWhat is the Meaning of Mental Element?  These requirements of criminal liability are rightly expressed in the Latin maxim “actus non\nfacit reum nisi mens sit rea” (act alone does not make a man guilty unless his intentions\nwere guilty). This is a well known principle of natural justice.   However, unlike physical element of crime the mental element poses a difficulty in its proof. Thus it is mainly proofed on the circumstantial evidence that the Court depends to establish\nthe moral ingredients of crime. What are the major mechanisms to determine the “Moral Ingredient” of Crime?  The ‘Moral ingredient’ of a crime refers to the ‘state of mind’ of an accused at the time of\ndoing the act constituting a crime. Thus it is the task of the court to infer from different facts\nand circumstances before, after and attending at the time of the commission of the crime.",

This is nothing\nbut the essence of the test of reasonable man.  In this test the true question was not whether he himself thought that his conduct had been\nblameworthy or not, but the courts went on the assumption that their own standard of what\nwas right or wrong was the true test.  The real test is that, ‘it must be known to everyone including the accused and that if facts\nshowed that the accused had not conducted  himself as a man obedient to the moral code\nwould have been expected to conduct himself, this established his mens rea.  However, this test is likely to magnify than reduce his liability to conviction, in case the\nprisoner tried to argue that he had acted upon different criterion of good and evil. b) The Test of Subjective Standard:\n The courts appraised the accused’s conduct objectively giving no much opportunity to the\naccused to prove his state of mind otherwise”. Yet a consideration of the actual working of\nmind of the prisoner was necessarily involved, at least to some extent, in certain cases. When the accused is insane or compelled by overpowering physical force to be helpless\ninstrument in another person’s misdeed.  In such cases, he could not be reasonably said to be guilty thus criminal guilt was often\nnegative in the courts by the argument that “what had been done was not the accused’s\nact”. This means that the accused had not caused the harm, as there was no mens rea on\nhis part.  The new doctrine of subjective mens rea gave the courts a new method of avoiding\nexcessive hardship in reasonable cases of self-defense, accident, mistake of fact etc. All\nthese came to be accepted as grounds of excuse from criminal liability. c) Voluntariness of Conduct:\nPage | 39\n The courts felt that if the man’s conduct could be proved to be voluntary i.e., “the\nmovements of his body in producing the harmful result were willful movements then his\nmens rea was established”.",

However, there is no uniformity in the moral ingredient required for all crimes,\nsince the same act may be an ingredient of several different crimes it must be established\nfrom case to case exactly, what the accused had in mind before one can decide the crime of\nwhich he is guilty. I. Criminal Intention: Art. 58\n ‘Criminal intention’, constitutes the highest degree of criminal guilt and comprises of two\nelements in the words of Art. 58. According to Sub-Art. ( 1) A person intentionally commits\na crime who infringes law: with full knowledge and intent, “la conscience” (awareness) and\n“la volente” (will or volition). What constitutes Full knowledge? Page | 41\n “Knowledge” or “awareness” means the ability to foresee the nature, factual circumstances\nand consequence of one’s act or omission.  Thus, criminal intention firstly implies awareness. Therefore, it follows that: where an act is\npenalized by law regardless of its consequences, the person who performs this act may not be\ndeemed to perform it intentionally unless he is aware of the circumstances which have the\neffect of rendering it criminal.  Therefore, in every case, the object of the criminal’s intent must be ascertained having regard\nto the ingredients of the crime as laid down in the Special Part of the Code. What constituents Intent?  The word ‘intent’ is used in Article 58/1 to mean ‘will’ or ‘volition’.",

    "text": "Every conscious act\nthat we do is preceded by a certain state of mind. No physical act is possible without bodily\nmotions. And every bodily motion which constitutes an ‘act’ is preceded by a desire for\nthose motions.  ‘Will’ involves a desired objective or active desire, i.e. desiring the result as an objective of\nthe act or omission. Such a will exists where a person, for example, deliberately strikes\nanother with the desire to inflict bodily injury\nWhat is the relationship between Volition, Intention and Motive?  These three terms are interrelated. A. Volition The desire that impels the motion is known as volition. When an act done is\npreceded by a desire for the act and if such a desire is not produced by fear or compulsion\nwe say it is a voluntary act. Thus, all bodily motions, which constitute an act, are\npreceded by the desire for those motions. This desire is called volition. B. Motive: The longing for the object desired which sets the volition in motion is motive. C. Intention: The expectation that the desired motions will lead to certain consequences. Thus, the intention is not a desire whilst motive is. If so, what is the difference between intention and motive?  For instance, in beating his victim the person in his act of striking intends to cause him pain. o The motive here is: causing pain may be to satisfy his revenge or cripple him against\ncombating with the accused in a race or merely to indicate his superior strength. o The Intention is the foreknowledge of the act, coupled with the desire being the cause of\nthe act, in as much as they fulfill themselves through the operations of the will. Page | 42\nWhat are the forms of intention under Ethiopian criminal law?  Intention, under Article 58 is found in two different forms:\na. Direct Intention Art 58/1/Para (a)\n This category of intention is usually referred to as direct intention as there are these distinct\ncharacteristics of this form of state of mind:\n a fixed object,\n a clear foresight of consequences , and\n A desire for consequences. b. Indirect Intention (Dolus Eventualis): “recklessness” Art. 58/1, Para (b)\n In this state of mind, the criminal does not desire the occurrence of the harm. However, he is\naware of the possible consequences and yet is unwilling to renounce his act since he has\nsome other object in his mind.",

II. Criminal Negligence Art. 59:\n “Criminal Negligence” constitutes criminal guilt of a lower degree. It is when the criminal\nintention must be excluded on the ground that the conditions laid down in Art. 58 are not\nfulfilled. When negligence involves the criminal liability?  Culpable negligence is a condition for criminal liability. Negligence is not taking care\nwhere there is a duty to take care. In negligence, there is a state of mind in which there is\nabsence of desire to cause a particular consequence. The standard of care established by law\nis that of a reasonable man in identical circumstances. What amounts to reasonable care?  It is ‘a question of fact’ depending on the circumstances of each case. What does negligence constitutes? Negligence means the failure to exercise care there by causing harm (undesired by the accused)\nthat could or should have been normally expected. Article. 59/1 and the essential elements of the\nprovision are:\nPage | 43\no Acting  by imprudence or ( inadvertent)\no Being aware that his act may cause illegal and punishable consequences acts in disregard\nof such consequences, or (Advertent)\no Acting by a criminal lack of foresight, or (Advertent)\no Acting without consideration of possible consequences while he should or could have been\naware that his act may cause illegal and punishable consequences.(Inadvertent)\nWhat are the different forms of negligence?  A careful consideration of the essential elements of negligence reveals two kinds of\nnegligence and it is the element of “consciousness” in bringing about the consequences that\ndifferentiates these two forms of negligence. In both cases criminal lack of foresight or\nimprudence must be proved. A. Advertent Negligence :( Meaning and Distinction from Indirect Intention :)\n Acting in disregard of possible consequences defines conscious type of negligence. In this\nform of negligence the criminal, like in the case of in direct intention, foresees the possibility\nof some harm but disregards (or rejects) its occurrence. ( in Amharic saying it is Menem\nAymetam Bakeh)\n  Under indirect intention the criminal accepts the occurrence of the possible harm ( in\nAmharic saying it is Yemetaw Yemta) whereas in the advertent negligence the person\nrejects the possibility of the harm which in fact materializes as a result of his negligence.",

Inadvertent Negligence: Meaning and Distinction from Advertent Negligence:\n Acting without consideration represents the unconscious type of negligence. Under\ninadvertent negligence the accused is not aware of a possible harm. The offender does not\nforesee the result at all. e.g.  The accused believing that the gun is unloaded pulls the trigger\nand to his surprise finds some one injured. His failure to take care makes him liable for\nnegligently injuring the person.  In the same example, if the offender having foreseen the possibility of hitting ‘B’ but\ndisregarding the same, shoots at a certain target and unfortunately injures ‘B’, his state of\nmind may be described as advertent negligence. Page | 44\nWhat does Criminal Lack of Foresight mean?  Denotes want of care with which people of reasonable prudence are expected to act and want\nof which is culpable. These acts are done in haste without due deliberation and caution. These acts produce a result the criminal never expected and which he may most regret.  But he is punished not for the effect produced which he could not perhaps foresee, but for the\nmanner of doing the act which was fraught with danger. It is his attitude towards his conduct\nthat is blameworthy. What is the Standard of foresight and Prudence under Art.59/1/ (b)?  The law does not expect the same degree of care and caution from all persons irrespective of\nthe position they occupy. This means the objective standard cannot be purely ideal because\nas rightly put forward by Art59/1/(b) due consideration has to be given to subjective factors\nsuch as the “age, experience, education occupation and rank” of the accused.  The care that is reasonably expected of an accused person as per the “reasonable man’s\nstandard”, therefore, does not denote an abstract mythical model, but refers to the “prudent\nman” under the circumstances of the accused.  Due care and attention” implies genuine effort to reach the truth and not the ready acceptance\nof an ill natured belief.

This means, in order to make a person criminally liable, his act must have been\ncommitted or omitted by his guilty act.  The act must have been performed either intentionally or by negligence within the meaning\nof Art 57(1). What are the essential conditions to defend on the ground of accident?  Generally speaking, the essential conditions for pleading a case of accident are:\na. Misfortune or accident: Accident involves injury to another; misfortune implies as\nmuch injury to the author as to another unconnected with the act. Accidentally, when it is\nneither willfully nor negligently caused. b. Absence of both intention and negligence: For the purpose of establishing the defiance\nof accident, the presence of both the forms of mental elements ‘intention’ and negligence\nshould be negatived. c. Act Done with Proper Care and Caution: if A is at work with an axe. The head of the\naxe suddenly flies off and hit a person standing nearby injures him seriously. There is no\nnegligence on the part of A. He can claim the defence of accident here provided he had\ntaken proper care of fixing the axe before he starts working with it. Relationship of Cause and Effect: Causation in Law\nOn which points the cause and the effects should relate?  Art. 24. of Criminal Code, lays down the principle that, “a person is answerable for the\nconsequences of his act or failure to act only in so far as there exists a relationship of\ncause and effect between his act or failure and the consequences.  A ‘factor’ is said to have caused a particular event if, without such factor the event would\nnot have happened.

    "text": " the following are important ones:\nPage | 47\na. Sine qua non Test or the Theory of Absolute Causation:\n ‘Sine qua non’ is a Latin term which means “without which not” – an indispensable condition\nor an important prerequisite. The test says, “An act in the absence of which the result\nwould not have been achieved is deemed to be the cause of such result”.  This theory, known as the theory of absolute causality, goes too far because it mixes up\n‘causes’ and the ‘occasion’ of the harm. However, it makes it clear that no person can be\nliable for harm unless he did something, which was necessary condition of this harm. Therefore, another test has been evolved to establish ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ more distinctly. b. Adequate or Proximate Cause Test:\n The second paragraph Art. 24/1 incorporate this principle and only the proximate cause shall\nbe taken for the effects of certain activities. What are the essential conditions to apply “proximate cause rule”?  two things have to be fulfilled:\ni. \nThe criminal’s behavior that brought about the result, and\nii. A relevant condition of the harm resulted. Is all causal Circumstances are Capable of Bringing the criminal Result?  No criminal liability to occurrence of the harm, in the ordinary course of their nature,\nare not capable of bringing about such harm. See Art. 24(1)\n e.g. ‘A’ simply pretends to shoot at ‘B’ with his gun and ‘B’ who has a weak heart dies of\n“fright”. In this case, two possible considerations have to be made: In the ordinary course of\nthings, one cannot kill a person by pretending to shoot him, but if B dies by frightening the\ngun to death A act can be defined as the cause for the death of the victim. Shall the prosecutor proof the causal relationships?  The presumption is probably meant to operate in favor of prosecution. This means that, it is\nsufficient for the prosecutor to prove that acts of the same kind as “the acts charged”, when\ndone in the same circumstances as those in which the accused acted, are ordinarily capable of\nbrining about the harm done in the particular case.  Thus, He need not prove that this causal relationship also existed in the present case. It\nwould be the burden of the defendant to rebut such a presumption by adducing sufficient\nevidence to the contrary.",

Page | 48\n Art. 24(2) provides for the circumstances in which the cause and effect must be excluded\nbecause a chain of causation does not exist or is broken. This may happen in the following\noccasions:\na. Preceding Causes: The chain of causation would cease to exist if there exists a cause\nprior to the act or omission of the accused and makes a material difference in the\nconsequences foreseen or ought to have been foreseen by the accused. This means that the\npresence of the preceding cause brings an extraordinary result for the acts or omission of\nthe accused. b. Concurrent Causes: it is when, through or despite the application of the relevancy test,\ntwo or more persons are found to be eligible for liability. Here the problem arises when a\ngiven result may be attributed to two or more simultaneous causes. c. Intervening Causes: Here, the problem arises when a given result may be attributed to a\nmultiplicity of causes. The difference between this case and the case of concurrent causes\nlies in the time element involved. The task is to know which of the two or more\nconsecutive (not simultaneous) events has caused the harm in issue. d. Cumulative Effect of Different causes: According to Art. 24(3), where the result\nachieved is the cumulative effect of different causes mentioned in Sub. Art. ( 2) The cause\nand effect relationship shall be presumed irrespective of the fact that none of these causes\ncan independently produce the result in question.

Where there is no Physical Participation: A man may be held fully liable although he\nhas taken no physical part at all in the actual commission of the crime. Thus, the law has,\nfrom the very early times, attached to the one who procures or advices another to commit a\ncrime at least an equal responsibility with that of “the actual perpetrator of the deed”. B. Where Participation is Indirect:  A person will be held fully “responsible if he has made\nuse of an “innocent agent” to commit a crime.",

Concurrence of Crimes:  (Material concurrence)\n Several Criminal acts may also constitute one or more crimes. Such concurrence is referred\nto as material concurrence in Art 85. There is a case of material concurrence due to the\ncriminal’s successive acts. What are the major types of material concurrence?  Materially concurrent crimes may be; ‘Independent’ or ‘related’. In concurrent related\ncrimes, a criminal commits a crime with the intention of causing or facilitating the\ncommission of another punishable crime (Art 63).  In some cases, related crimes whose components fall under different provisions are in\ncombination embodied in a special aggravated crime (185/2) For instance, Coercion (Art-\n582) and ‘theft’ (Act. 665) is embodied in ‘robbery’ (Act. 670).  But there are related crimes that are not embodied in an aggravated special crime. In such,\ncases criminal law resorts to aggravation of penalty by concurrence (Act-65, 185/1) if the\ncrime under consideration is at least attempted.",

    "text": "B. Concurrence of Criminal Provisions (Notional Concurrence):\n A single criminal act or omission may give rise to concurrent crimes by violating two or\nmore provisions in Article 85.  When a single criminal act results in several punishable crimes, it is classed as\nSimultaneous Notional Concurrence. Under this type of concurrence, if the criminal is\nproved to have caused one of them with criminal intention or negligence, he is held guilty of\nall the crimes because they invariably occur at the same time from the same causal relation.  ‘Notional concurrence’ may also include a non- simultaneous combination of crimes as\nstated in Art. 66, where by causation and the particular state of mind must be proved\nindependently for each of those crimes. What are the instances of combined notional concurrence?  There are three possibilities of combined notional concurrence, namely:\no Concurrence of intentional crimes, Art.66/1/a\no Concurrence of intentional and negligent crimes. Art. 66/1/b, and\nPage | 51\no Concurrence of negligent crimes, implied in Art. 66/1/c.\nWhat are the major Rules Regarding Determination of Punishment in Cases of\nConcurrence?  Cumulative of punishment is not allowed in all cases of concurrence because under\ncertain circumstances the cumulated punishment may go beyond a person’s lifetime. The\nonly exception where cumulative punishment is permissible is in case of material\nconcurrence of petty offences as stipulated in Art. 768.  Upon finding concurrence of crimes, the court, according to Arts. 184-187: Imposes a\npenalty on the most severe crime, and aggravates the penalty without exceeding the\nmaximum limit allowed in Art. 184. What is the advantages of aggravating penalty?  This mechanism of ‘aggravation’ has two specific advantages:\n1. It discards an unseasonable cumulative of punishments,\n2. It avoids the absorption of lesser penalties. When Unit of Guilt and Penalty is taken place? Art. 61:\n When certain acts constitute a single crime though they may seem concurrent at first glance. For example, a storekeeper who has stolen 50 wristwatches over a period of 6 months (by\ntaking advantage of his status) commits the crime of aggravated theft under Art. 669/2/d, the\nvery day he took the first wrist watch. What are the instances of imperfect concurrence?  Art. 61 states the following three instances of imperfect concurrence where by the seemingly\nconcurrent crimes are merged (united) by the same criminal guilt and purpose. a. Single Act or Combination of Criminal Acts: By virtue of Article 61/1, a criminal\ncannot be charged and punished under two or more concurrent provisions of the same\nnature if the following 3 conditions are satisfied:\no If a single act or a combination of criminal acts are committed,\no Against the same protected right,\no Flowing from a single criminal intention or act of negligence. b. Successive non-concurrent acts: According to Art.60/2, a person who commits a so-\ncalled successive offence is guilty of, and punishable for only one offence and not for each\nof the act which he repeatedly does.",

In such circumstances the company as\nwell as the individual could be criminally liable. This is known as the identification\ndoctrine. UNIT-V\nDEGREES IN THE COMMISSION OF CRIME\nWhat are Different Stages in the Commission of Crime?  The material element of the crime may result in a completed or incomplete offence and the\nstages include Intention, preparatory acts, attempt, renunciation, active repentance,\nimpossible offence and special cases of attempt. A. Preparation:\n Criminal law punishes “overt acts” and not mere intentions. A criminal intent, no matter\nhow immoral it may be, is beyond the grip of criminal law until it is manifested by external\nconduct.  The requirements of Art. 23 imply that a mere criminal intention does not in itself constitute\na crime and is not punishable. This prohibition exists in Art. 23 of the Criminal Code, which\nlays down that a crime, is not completed unless all its legal, material and moral ingredients\nare present.  Therefore, the Criminal Code does not apply unless a person crosses the line of\ndemarcation between the mental and the material phases. A criminal crosses this line\nfirstly by preparing the commission of a crime within the meaning of Art. 26. Is all preparatory activities are punishable?  Not every preparatory act is punishable, since we cannot be certain about a person’s\ncriminal intent unless the prospective criminal himself tells us. This uncertainty is\nPage | 54\ninevitable because preparatory acts are “remote” from the ultimate harm and unequivocal\ndesign and the determination to carry it out.  Most Criminal Laws including Ethiopian Criminal Code do not in principle punish\npreparatory acts. Preparatory Acts are defined under Art. 26 of the Penal Code of\nEthiopia. Is intent to commission or preparation is punishable?  Art 26 encompasses all those situations where he/she from the moment that a person\nconceives the idea of committing a crime up to its consummation. This process includes\nformulation of intent to commit a crime.  This intent may also be supported by external acts like collecting the means required to\ncommit the offence and creating the conditions that may facilitate for the realization of the\ncrime and these preparatory acts are not punishable as a general principle. Why preparatory acts are not punishable as a general rule?",

    "text": " For four main reasons. a. A preparation apart from its motive is generally an harmless act;\nb. It would be impossible in most cases to show that preparation was directly towards a\nwrongful end or was done with an evil motive or intent. Therefore, if mere preparations\nwere punishable it would cause unnecessary harassment to innocent persons as there is a\nlocus poenitentiae, and the doer may have changed his mind;\nc. It is not the policy of law to create and multiply crimes. If preparations were to be\npunished, innumerable crimes will have to be created;\nd. A mere preparation does not and cannot ordinarily affect the sense of security of the\nindividual to the wronged, nor would the Society be disturbed or alarmed as to rouse it\nsense of vengeance. What is the Legal Effects of Preparatory Acts?  Punishing preparatory acts is therefore an exception than a rule under Ethiopian criminal\nlaw.  Nevertheless, the Criminal Code has a mechanism of precaution against preparatory acts\nwhere a person behaves or is likely to behave in a manner which threatens peace or security\nof the public or citizen (Art. 141). In such cases dangerous articles are seized (Art. 140) and\nthe person who poses a threat is required to enter into recognizance. Page | 55\nIf so when preparatory acts are punishable?  Preparation is punishable only when it has reached such an advanced stage and is close\nto an attempt that there is no doubt as to the purpose of the arrangements made and as to\nthe willingness of the person who made them, to carry them further if he is given the\nchance of doing so.  There are two situations where preparatory acts are punishable. i. Where the Preparatory Acts Constitute a Crime in Themselves (Art 26/a):\n A person who buys a gun as a preparatory step towards homicide is punished for the\ncompleted “petty offence” of retaining a gun without license (Arts. 808, 809)\n Even though he is not punishable for his preparatory act; the act of keeping a gun without a\nlicense itself is a petty offence. iii. Where the Preparatory Acts Constitute a “Special Crime”  by Owing to Their\nGravity (Art 26/b):\n Certain preparatory acts are expressly constituted a special crime by law owing to their\ngravity or the general danger they necessarily bring upon the society.  For example, material preparation of offences against the state (Art.",

B. Attempt (Art 27)\nWhen is attempt taken place?  Attempt is the second degree in the material element of the crime.   It is a substantial but unsuccessful effort to commit a particular offence. It is a willful\neffort but without success.  The effort must be unsuccessful because a person cannot be prosecuted for both an attempt\nand completed crimes as the attempt can be considered to have been merged with the\ncompleted offence, thereby abrogating itself. What are the essential requirements for an attempt to exist?  In a nutshell, attempt includes three most important requirements to exist that include:\ni. Intent: An act to constitute an attempted offence shall be preceded by purely internal\nmental process, which begins with the thought of executing an offence and ends with\nthe decision to commit it, but which does not manifest itself by any overt act. The\nPage | 56\nconvictions of attempt rests upon the doctrine that “Voluntas reputabitur pro facto- the\nintention is to be taken for the deed. ii. Overt act: This goes with the known principle of Penal Law that it does not punish mere\nthoughts, as a breach of the law can’t occur in the absence of a given behavior. A\nperson, therefore, can be held liable criminally if he/she manifests his/her intent by\nsome open deed tending to the execution of his/her intent\niii. Failure to achieve the result. Explain the different forms of attempt?  Basing on the ‘reason’ for the failure to achieve the intended result attempts can be\nclassified into three categories:\na. Incomplete Attempt: If the accused chooses not to do or is prevented from doing the last\nact of the crime, the attempt is said to be incomplete. i. \nVoluntary withdrawal: The words “… do not pursue … his criminal activity to its\nend” in Article 27 define “incomplete attempts” because of voluntary withdrawal. The part of the provision that reads,\nii. Involuntary withdrawal: the term unable to pursue his criminal activity to its\nend”, on the other hand, indicates an incomplete attempt because of external\ninterventions, that is outside the volition or will of the accused. b. “Complete Attempt”: when the wrongdoer has performed everything on his/her part,\nwhich is considered to be necessary without, however, result having occurred.",

    "text": "The\nreasons for the failure to achieve the result may be of two types:\no Impossible offence: The achievement has not occurred due to situations beyond\nhis/her control. o Active repentance Due to the active involvement of the perpetrator him/herself. c.  “Impossible Attempt” Art. 29: where a criminal attempts “to commit a crime by\nmeans or against an object of such a nature that the commission of the crime was\nabsolutely impossible”. Is it absolute or relative impossibility should be taken?  Article 29 covers the cases of absolute impossibility and not relative impossibility where the\ncircumstances in which the criminal acted are unable to cause the criminal’s intended\nharm due to the means used or because of the object against which the act is committed. Page | 57\n E.g. Failure to achieve result because of an unloaded gun is an absolute impossibility due to\nthe means used. Poisoning a person with an insufficiently fatal poison is a case of relative\nimpossibility due to insufficient means.  Such a distinction between absolute and relative impossibility is significant because free\nmitigation (Art. 180) may be allowed under cases of absolute impossibility. Explain the requirements of Mens rea in Attempts?  The mental element assumes paramount importance in attempts, because sometimes actus\nreus may be a perfectly innocent and harmless act,\n e.g. ‘D’ intending to murder ‘P’, puts sugar in his tea, believing that it is Arsenic the act is\nabsolutely harmless. His ‘Object’ failed only because of his mistaken appreciation of the\nmaterial circumstances. Therefore, without establishing his guilty intention it is impossible\nto make him liable for an attempt. As long as the consequence is intended, erroneous\nappreciation of the material circumstances may not alter the liability for attempt. What is the Importance of Distinction between Preparation and Attempt?  The relative proximity between the ‘act’ done and the ‘evil consequences’ contemplated\nlargely determines the distinction. the major distinctions are:\na. The fact that all attempts are always punishable (Art. 27(2)) where as all preparatory\nacts are not punishable (Art. 26). b. Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the\ncommission of the crime; while an attempt is the direct movement towards the\ncommission of the crime after preparations have been made.

    "text": " Some tests have been evolved by the courts to determine at what stage an act or a series of\nacts done towards the commission of the intended crime would become an attempt. These\ntests are:\na. Reasonable Inference test or Unequivocally Test: According to this test, “…. an act\ndone with intent to commit a crime is not a criminal attempt unless it is of such a\nnature as to be in itself sufficient evidence of the criminal intent with which it is\ndone”. If the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the overt acts of the accused\nis that he would have completed the crime had he not been interrupted, then there can\nPage | 58\nbe no doubt that he is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime”. The interdependence\nbetween intent and behavior is apparent in this test. b. The Commencement of Execution Test: there is an attempt as of the moment the\naccused begins to commit the crime. “ An act amounts to the beginning of execution\nwhen the intention behind it is irrevocable. The doer should, therefore, go beyond\nwhat might be called the point of no return. This test is basically subjective. Yet, it\ndoes not disregard objective considerations, because the objective overt act of the\n‘decisive step’ serves as a landmark in embarking upon the subjective point of no return. What is the position of Ethiopian criminal code?  The Ethiopian Criminal Code defines attempt in Art. 27/1 Para 1, as the intentional act of\nbeginning to commit a crime and thus has much in common with the “commencement of\nexecution test”. The second paragraph of the provision states what is meant by the act of\nbeginning to commit as offence.  The term “clearly” is intended to mean an act unequivocally aims at a desired harm where\nthe doer’s criminal intent and determination clearly or unequivocally aim at the completion\nof crime.  A given act normally manifests two things namely:\no Intent (the doer’s subjective state of mind)\no The acts’ material (objective) proximity or remoteness to the intended consequence.  If the term “… clearly” refers to the doer’s subjective state, of mind the term “direct” can\nlogically be presumed to apply to the objective location of an act in the path towards the\ndesired result. c. Proximity test: An act of attempt must be sufficiently proximate to the crime intended, it\nshould not be remotely leading towards the commission of a crime.",

Locus poenitentiae Test: The Latin term ‘locus that means ‘place of repentance’.i.e. a\npoint at which it is not too late for one to change one’s legal position; the possibility of\nwithdrawing from a contemplated course of action, esp. a wrong, before being\ncommitted to it. An act would amount to preparation and not an attempt, if a person\nPage | 59\nvoluntarily gives up the idea of committing a crime before the criminal act is carried\nout. e. Social Danger Test: The seriousness of the crime attempted and the apprehension of the\nsocial danger involved is taken into account to distinguish an act of ‘attempt’ from that\nof ‘preparation’. ‘A’, gives some pills to a pregnant woman to procure abortion, but it\nhad no effect because the drug turned out to be innocuous. ‘ A’, would be guilty of\nattempt to cause miscarriage since the acts of such kind would cause an alarm to society\nand will have social repercussions.

As it is in an\nattempted crime, it must be accompanied by guilty state of mind in the form of intent. There\nis also no doubt that the act should not achieve the result. In such a case, the person is held\ncriminally liable for an attempted offence,\n but there is a possibility of reduction of punishment within the limits of the law as per Article\n179 of the Penal Code, or beyond the limits of the law as provided under Article 180 of the\nsame code which reads as:\nWhen Active Repentance is existed?  When, after having performed all the acts to bring about the desired result, the perpetrator\nhimself either prevents or contributes for the prevention of the result. see Article 28(2)\nUNIT- VI\nPARTICIPATION IN THE COMMISSION OF CRIME\nWhat are the level of participation of the criminals in certain crime?",

Direct: when every person directly, physically or personally commits the offence. ii. Indirect: when the perpetrator commits the crime by using instruments like animals or\nnatural force (like fire). Is it only the intention of the offender is relevant to call principal offender?  It is also possible for a person to be regarded as a material criminal if he or she negligently\nperforms an act and produces a forbidden harm.   This is to mean that a person should not always commit the crime intentionally in order to be\nregarded as a principal party in the form of material criminal. b. Moral Criminal:\n Moral Criminal is a person who fully associates himself/herself with the commission of the\ncrime and takes the crime as his or her own even though he or she is not present at the\ntime when and the place where the crime was committed.  Moral criminal is a person who plays no part physically in the commission or omission of the\noffence.

This in other words means that the incited must be convinced and\ncommit the crime as is intended by the instigator.

Page | 64\n The crime of conspiracy is completed at the moment when two or more persons have\nagreed that they will do at once or at some future time an act which is unlawful.  Therefore, the crime of conspiracy is said to be completed even if there is no further act to\nput the agreement into effect. Is conspiracy is an independent crime in Ethiopia as a rule?  In the Ethiopian law, conspiracy, as a rule, is not considered to be an independent crime. Rather, it is a ground for aggravating punishment when persons participate in the\ncommission of a crime based on prior agreement as per Article 38(1) of the Criminal Code\nof Ethiopia. What are the exceptions to regard conspiracy as independent crimes?  Though our law disregards the act of conspiracy as an independent crime, Article 38(2)\nprovides exceptions that it is taken as an independent crime;\no When persons conspire to commit crimes against the state as per Article 257 (b). o Art 274.

These circumstances exempt a criminal from criminal liability or entitle him/her to a\nreduced punishment. Explain different forms of defenses?  Defenses for criminal liability are incorporated in criminal law in different ways. a. Special defenses: could be non-fulfillment of essential conditions of the crimes provided\nin the special part of the Criminal Code. They are defenses that apply in particular crime. b. General defenses: are those expressly provided by law as defense. They are general\ndefenses. They are applicable to all crimes. They are excuses and justifications. o Excuses are defenses that arise because the defendant is not blameworthy for having\nacted in a way that would otherwise be criminal. In the cases of the excuses, the focus\nis on the individual criminal rather than on the crime committed. o Justification defenses. Defenses that arise when the defendant has acted in a way that\nthe law does not seek to prevent are called justification defenses. Justifications, the\nfocus is on the act rather than on the criminal. Justifications include acts required or\nauthorized by law, legitimate defense, necessity and professional duty. Who has the Burden of Proof in Cases of Defenses?  The general rule is that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the accused’s guilt and if at\nthe end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt created by the evidence,\ngiven by either the prosecution or the defense, as to whether the accused had committed the\ncrime or not, the accused is entitled to acquittal on the ground of benefit of doubt.  It means if an accused pleads defense within the meaning of ‘excusable’ or ‘justifiable’\ngrounds of defense, there is a presumption against him and the burden to rebut that presumption\nis on him. General Defenses\n1. Criminal Responsibility and Irresponsibility\nWhat is responsibility and irresponsibility?  Responsibility is a person’s mental fitness to answer in a court for his/her action. Responsibility\nor irresponsibility is concerned with the criminals’ awareness and their capabilities to control\ntheir action.",

    "text": " Therefore, before ascertaining that the criminals have committed the crime intentionally or by\nnegligence, it is necessary to assure the responsibility or irresponsibility of the criminals. What are the circumstances for irresponsibility of the offender?  Irresponsibility may arise in three cases. With regards to adults, it may arise from insanity or\nintoxication, and with regards to infants, it may arise from their immaturity. What is the presumption of the law on the criminal liability of the accused?  Generally, when a person is accused of a crime his/her responsibility is presumed by the Court. The prosecution need not prove it.  This means that of  the important things necessary to make a person liable for punishment within\nthe meaning of Art.49/1 are established the in the following way:\na. The proof that the act was done by the accused---It is the burden of the prosecutor. b. The fact that the accused is responsible for his acts—this is presumed by the Court. When the question of irresponsibility are raised? However, the question of irresponsibility arises in any of the following two situations:\na. When the accused invokes it, particularly, during the preliminary objections as per Art. 130/2/g of the Criminal Procedure Code, on the first day of the criminal Proceeding. b. When the Court is doubtful about the mental condition of the accused due to partial or\ncomplete deprivation of mental faculties. The Court may entertain such a doubt at any stage\nof the trail from the conduct of the accused on the trial. 1.1.Absolute Responsibility (art 48)\nWhat are the circumstances whereby the accused is in absolute responsibility? ( Art 48)\n According to Art. 23 (3), cum (Art. 48) the fulfillment of the requirement as to responsibility\nis a condition precedent to the fulfillment of the requirement as to guilt.  This is to mean that no person may be convicted of an offence unless, at the time of\ncommission, he was not irresponsible for his acts.  In general responsibility could not be defined in a positive, but only in a negative manner, and\nthis is why most codes including the Ethiopian Criminal Code (2005) do not describe\nresponsible but irresponsible persons. A. Insanity\n Insanity is a complete defense to a criminal charge. It is based on the assumption that one who\nis insane has no mind and hence cannot have the necessary mens rea to commit a crime.",

    "text": " Insanity, according to medical science, is a disease of the mind, which impairs the mental\nfaculty of man. In law, insanity means a disease of mind, which impairs the cognitive faculty,\nnamely, the reasoning capacity of a man to such an extent as to render him incapable of\nunderstanding the nature and consequences of his act. What is the presumption of the law on insanity?  Every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be\nresponsible for his crime, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish\na defense on the ground of insanity.   It must be clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act, the party accused was\nsuffering under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as\no Not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing: did not appreciate what\nhe was doing so that the “act requirement” is not fulfilled\no  Does not know the wrongfulness of his or her act: if he could not form the requisite\nmens rea). Explain the tests of insanity?  The major short lived tests are:\n1. The irresistible impulse addition to the M’Naghten test: A defendant may be acquitted\nif he or she was unable to control the action due to mental illness. 2. The Durham Rule, or “product test” (1954): The defendant must be acquitted if the crime\nwas the product of mental disease or defect. 3. The Currens Test (1961): The defendant must be acquitted if he or she “lacked substantial\ncapacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law…as a result of mental\ndisease or defect.” What are the Essential Conditions to Establish the Defence of Insanity?  Art. 48(2) requires the proof of the defense of irresponsibility i.e. the incapacity of the\ndefendant to form a guilty intention basing on the following important things:\na. Nature of the incapacity: That the accuses is incapable of understanding the nature or\nconsequences of his act or of  regulating his conduct according to such understanding,\nb. Reason of the incapacity: That such incapacity is due to age, illness, abnormal delay in\nhis development or deterioration of his mental faculties, (one of the causes specified under\nArt. 49 (1) i.e. a derangement or an abnormal or deficient condition). c. Time of the incapacity: That such incapacity exists at the time of his act that produced\nthe consequences in question.",

    "text": "Which tests of insanity is adopted by Ethiopian criminal code?  The Code resorted to one of the three principal methods of defining criminal responsibility,\nnamely:\na.  Biological method, consists in specifying a number of physical or mental disabilities or\ndefects deemed to render the person concerned irresponsible. b. Psychological method consists in prescribing that a person incurs no liability that, at the\ntime of the offense, was incapable of understanding the nature of his acts or of controlling\nhimself. c. Bio-psychological method, followed in many modern Codes including the Criminal Code\nof Ethiopia, a person is regarded as irresponsible only if, at the time of the commission of\nthe crime, he was deprived of his mental faculties in consequence of certain biological\ndefects. In other words there must be a causal relation between the biological defect,\nwhich the offender suffers, and the psychological failure as a result of which the person\nbecome incapable to understanding his acts.  Sub-Article 2 of the provision clearly provides the test of insanity. It provides both the\nbiological and psychological tests, which are enumerated below:\na.    Age: refers to old age, for senility may affect a person’s mental faculties;\nb. Illness: refers to any form of mental as well as physical disease as a result of which a\nperson is deprived of his mental faculties. c.    An abnormal delay in the offender’s development, which includes cases such as\nidiotism, cretinism, the consequences of deafness, dumbness sleeping sickness, and the\nlike;\nd. Deterioration of mental faculties of the offender due to poison, intoxication by alcohol\nor drugs, hypnosis or somnambulism;\nWhat is the Legal Effects of Criminal Irresponsibility?  The legal effects of criminal irresponsibility are of two kinds. a. No liability: 48(1): An irresponsible person incurs no liability\nb. Subject to certain treatments or measures: 48 (3) authorizes the court to make orders\nunder Arts. 129-131, whenever these measures are necessary for the treatment of the\noffender or the protection of the public or both. 1.2. Limited Responsibility: Art. 49\nWhat is partial responsibility?  it is a stage between insanity and sanity, where an offenders faculties are affected to such an\nextent that, although he is certainly able to understand what he does and to act accordingly, it\nis equally certain that his intelligence or will-power is not that of a “normal” person and that\nhis degree of guilt is consequently lesser than that of such a person.",

What are the common Characteristics of Limited Responsibility?  Limited responsibility described under Art. 49, stated as a derangement of the mind or\nunderstanding (e.g. hysteria), an arrested mental development (e.g. imbecility) and an\nabnormal or deficient condition (e.g. alcoholic intoxication) do not have the effects specified\nunder Art. 48.  A person is not partially responsible for the sole reason that he is of low intelligence or poor\neducation. Furthermore, a person is not partially responsible for the sole reason that he is of\nweek character or morally perverted.

Intoxication-Intentional or Culpable Irresponsibility: Art. 50\nIs intoxication is a defense for criminal liability?  Regarding intoxication, whether voluntary or involuntary, most penal codes flatly state that\nintoxication is not defense which is actually, not true. since involuntary intoxications can be a\nground for defense for criminal liability. What is the difference between art 48, 49 and Art 50?  The main deference between Arts. 50 and 48, 49 is not the bio-psychological condition of the\noffender but it is the condition that creates the irresponsible nature of the offender.  Unlike the legally recognized causes under the preceding articles, under this article, it is the\ndoer who puts himself into a condition of irresponsibility or of limited responsibility by means\nof alcohol or drugs or by any other means. What are the condition to establish a criminal liability on intoxicated person? a. Preceding intention: When intent existed before the offence was committed, since the\naccused was capable of forming a specific intention prior to intoxicating himself. Under this\ncondition, the person not only did he voluntarily place himself in an abnormal condition,\nbut he did so in order to carry out a decision which he had freely made. ( art 50(1)\nb. Negligence: when a person who commits an offence in a state of partial or complete\nirresponsibility in which he placed himself, not for the purpose of committing an offence,\nbut when he knew or should and could have known that he was apt to do wrong while being\nin an abnormal condition (Art.50/2).",

The commission of an offence by them calls action by the society because no action has\nbeen taken at home or at school or it has failed.",

Transitory Age: The criminal responsibility and guilt of persons between the age of fifteen\nand eighteen years are determined as though they were an adult, but the punishment that may\nbe ordered is not necessary that which would be ordered if they were adults. What are the measures taken for the transitory age offenders?  The court has three options:\na. It may order any of the penalties applicable to adults and mitigate it according to article\n179. However, the mitigation is not compulsory. In such case, the court may not sentence\nthe criminal to death penalty. b. The court may order one of the special penalties applicable to young persons. c. The court may order special measures applicable to young criminals based on the\nconditions laid down under article 177. N.B. the court should asses the punishment of young offender according to art 55. UNIT-II\n2. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n.What is Affirmative defense?  Affirmative defenses, as the name speaks for itself are legal defenses against a criminal charge. When affirmative defenses are raised?  It is logical for the accused to raise them only at the time when he is required to defend the\ncharge. Procedurally, this will happen after the prosecution have adduced evidence and prove\na prima fascia case.  This implies that one who being under any of the above circumstances commits a punishable\nact shall undergo all the preceding stages in the process. Some seriously criticize the scheme\nfor the fact that it unduly makes the accused suffer from the hardship of a criminal process. They therefore suggest that circumstances, particularly the first and the second to justify the\ndiscontinuation of the proceeding at the earliest possible time.  In line with the idea some Codes of Criminal Procedure allow the circumstances to be invoked\nat least as a legitimate ground of preliminary objection.  The Criminal Procedure Code of Ethiopia for example expressly stated state of irresponsibility\nas ground of preliminary objection (art.130/--). In the case of the Code even arguments have\nbeen forwarded in favor of the prosecution to relay on Art.42/1(a) to discontinue cases\nwhenever they prove any of the circumstances. 2.1. Lawful, Justifiable and Excusable Acts:\nWhat is the legal status of affirmative defenses in Ethiopian criminal law?",

    "text": " According to Art.58 (2), a person who intentionally commits an offence is always punishable\nexcept where he acts in circumstances providing him with a justification or an excuse that is\nin any of the circumstances defined in Arts.68-81.  Therefore the question whether an act is: lawful, justifiable or excusable does not arise unless\nthis act is an ingredient of an offence. What is the difference between justifiable acts and excusable acts?  The definition and classification of lawful, justifiable and excusable acts sometimes vary. a.  Justifiable Acts: comprises of acts required or authorized by law, legitimate defense,\nnecessary acts and acts done with the consent of the injured party,\nb. Excusable acts: which are said to be either absolutoires or attenantes according to their\neffect on the penalty, are similar to the circumstances with the Ethiopian Code regards as\ngeneral or extenuating circumstances. What is the position of Ethiopia in classifications?  The Ethiopian Code does not follow any of the above-mentioned models but provides for three\nclasses of acts with respect to which the ordinary rules concerning criminal guilt do not apply\nor fully apply,\na.  Lawful acts (acts done in circumstances which legitimate them),\nb.  Justifiable acts (acts done in circumstances excluding intentional guilt) and\nc. Excusable acts (acts done in circumstances reducing the degree of guilt). 2.1.1. Lawful Acts (Art 68)\nWhat are lawful acts?  A lawful act is an act, which a person is legally authorized to do. Even in some circumstances\nthe law provides more than authorization and obliges a person to behave in contradiction to\nthe law.  The defense of lawful acts therefore provides a counter-law to the prohibitory law. The\nprohibitory law says: you must not kill. But the counter-law says: If you are a soldier in a\ncombat, you must kill. What are the conditions for the applicability of defense on lawful act?  The availability of the defense is conditioned upon the fulfillment of two conditions. a. One cannot claim protection under the defense unless he/she is one who has acquired the\nstatus required in the law. For instance, if someone, other than a police officer who restrain\nthe liberty of another. b. The mere fact of having the status envisaged in a law does not entitle the person to act in\ncontradiction to the prohibitory law. Instead the objective circumstances that necessitate\nthe action in question must be present.",

Art.68\n Under Art.68 of the Criminal Code of Ethiopia, lawful acts comprise of particular (illustrative)\nacts connected with: are the following;\na. Acts Relating to Public, State or Military Duties:\n A legal obligation or permission to do an act connected with public duties is a complete\njustification when the doer complies with the legal requirements governing the doing of this\nact. What is acts in respect to public duties?  Art.68 is silent as to what constitutes “acts in respect to public duties”. But, if one compares\nit with ‘State duty’, which is more specific and require the claimant to possess an official status\nor be vested with some kind of some power,\n It appears the defense is available to anyone who does, in accordance with the law, something\nfor the public good. For instance, any private person who arrests or participates in the arrest of\nan offender must be protected under this defense because the act he does pertains to public\nduties\nWhen the defense of state military duties constitute a defense?  It is available when the doers possess an official status, either civil or military, and act in\ndischarge of their duty.  Acts of a public servant or a member of the armed forces are therefore do not constitute an\noffense and are not punishable so long as they are done in accordance the terms of the relevant\nlaw. b. Right of Correction or Discipline\n There are the case, for instance, Art.2039(c) of the Civil Code impliedly authorizing the\nparents, guardians and masters to use reasonable use of force for the purposes of chastisement. Accordingly, Art.576/3 of the Criminal Code dealing with maltreatment of minors expressly\nlimits the right of correction or discipline.  Thus, there shall be no criminal liability against those legally authorized for their acts unless\nthey have gone beyond legal limit, namely the reasonableness of the action vis a vis the\nseriousness of the fault sought to be corrected. c.  Exercising Private Rights:\n This are the cases where Arts.1148 and 2076(2) are just some provisions of the Civil Code that\njustify the protective actions of a holder of a thing and a possessor of a land however their\naction may cause harm to others.   In both cases, the doer is not guilty of an offense of bodily injury or damage to property, since\nthe law expressly authorizes him to act as he does.

It also refer to “any activity which a person\nhabitually carries out for the purposes of obtaining the resources necessary to his livelihood”.  It seems irrelevant for the purposes of Art.69 whether this activity is exercised by virtue of the\nlaw or a contract. Only a person entitled to practice a profession is exempted from criminal\nliability. What are the Conditions where Professional Duty is not justified?  Art.69 applies only when the doer acts in accordance with;\na. The accepted practice of the profession: reference will have to be made to the\nprofessional regulations, if any, or to the custom of the particular profession, which may\nbe ascertained through expert evidence and\nb. Does not commit any grave professional fault. C. Consent As a Defense: Art. 70\n This provision is inserted by the Revised Criminal Code. The previous Penal Code under its\nArty 66 categorically stated that consent is no defense for criminal liability.  But in fact that was a technically wrong statement since there are crimes such as rape, theft\nand injuries caused during sports without foul play there an implied consent of the victim while\nvoluntarily participating in the game. Therefore, it is right to say that consent is a qualified\nimmunity to criminal liability. When consent is qualified defense?  Art. 70 says that consent can be a defense for cases which are punishable upon filing of a\nformal complaint. In such cases if the consent has been give by either the victim himself or his\nlegal representative the person causing the injury is not liable for penalty. Is it absolute defense or without limitation?  Art 70/2 places an important limitation to this defense. A person is free to donate any of the\nabove said things to another person for personal use or to a juridical person for appropriate\nscientific research or experiment, the recipient shall not be punishable within the meaning of\nArt 70/2.   However, if such a transaction is done with commercial motive both the donor and the person\nwho takes the bodily organ from his body i.e., surgeon are liable to punishment under Art. 573 sub-article (1) and (2) respectively.

    "text": "71 & 72\n The law shall expect neither extreme heroism from individuals nor encourage cowardice\n There is well-known maxim actus me invito (factus) non est mens actus, i.e. an act which is\ndone by me against my will is not my act and hence I am not responsible for it. This maxim\nrefers to one type affirmative defense commonly known as the defense of ‘duress’ or\n‘coercion’.  The threat in order to attract the benefit of this defense must be of instant harm to the person\ncompelled to commit the offense and without reasonable possibility for escape. Further, the\nperson who so threatened should not have placed in that situation of his own accord. This\nmeans the defense of coercion is disallowed if the defendant intentionally or recklessly placed\nhim or herself in a situation subject to coercion. Why coerced persons are protected or go unpunished? A coerced person is justified first, because;\na) They are like an insane person or intoxicated person he is totally deprived of his freedom\nof choice and therefore equally deserves the same treatment as long as the loss of will\npower is involuntary. b) They are justified for he/she sometimes avoid a greater harm; say his/her life in exchange\nfor a lesser harm, say forced damage to a property of another. c) Absence of any purpose to punish a coerced person is also another justification lying\nbehind the defense of coercion. Punishment does deter neither the coerced person nor any\npotential victim of coercion. d)  The disposition of a coerced person is not that of a criminal who willfully act in disregard\nof the law. Thus, punishing a coerced person would be absolutely contrary to the basic\nprinciple of criminal justice. Explain the legal status of the Defense of Coercion under Ethiopian Law?  There are two types of coercion absolute and resistible coercion. i. \nAbsolute coercion\nWhat degree of coercion amounts for defense?  Regarding the degree of coercion required to justify the wrongful act of a person under\ncompulsion, Art.71 requires that to be ‘absolute’.   Therefore, coercion is no defense unless it is absolute. Actually the term ‘absolute’ would\ncreate the impression that there must not exist, any possibility of resistance. However, the text\nof Art.71 indicates that the defense is available when the agent personally could not possibly\nact otherwise than as he has done.   The question whether resistance is possible shall be decided taking both objective and\nsubjective factors into account.",

    "text": "What are the possible forms of coercion under art 71?  Coercion under Art.71 can be of either physical or moral. o Physical coercion is “violence exercised by someone in consequence of which a human\nagent is materially obliged to commit an offence”. This definition implies that the defense\nof coercion is available when violence or force is used, whether for the purpose of\ncompelling or preventing an act, which renders the agent physically incapable of acting\notherwise than as he does. o  Moral coercion on the other hand is exercised when an act is which does not render the\nagent’s movements involuntary is done, but deprives him of his freedom of choice. It is\nusually in the form of threats intended to break the will of a person and make him yield to\nthe demands of the person exercising the coercion. ii. Resistible Coercion:\n Resistible coercion, with which Art.72 deals without distinguishing whether it is of a\nphysical or moral nature, is a coercion of intensity such that the coerced person could\nreasonably be expected “to resist or avoid committing the act”.  In other words, Art.72 is applicable when the coerced person, by reason of his strength,\nage, or sex and having regard to the strength, age or sex of the person exercising the\ncoercion, is capable of resisting the coercion. Coercion can be resistible when it is physical\nas well as moral.  When coercion is not irresistible, intent as an element of criminal guilt is present and the\ncoerced person is answerable for his acts.  Thus, the doer is as a general rule punishable. However, the fact that he acts under coercion\nthe punishment may be reduced if the actual and personal circumstances of the case warrant\nmitigation. E.  Superior/Subordinate Relation: Arts. 73 & 74\n Arts.73/74 are applicable only to specific types of relation, i.e. administrative and military\nsuperior subordinate relation. What is the Responsibility of a Person Giving an Order?  In both administrative and military superior subordinate relation, the orders that can be given\nto a superior are restricted to fit two essential conditions. a.  Orders may be given only with regard to the so called “service matters”, that is matters\nconcerning the business transacted by the organization to which the superior and\nsubordinate belong. b. Only such acts may be ordered as must be done so that the said business is properly\ntransacted.",

    "text": "If the act ordered has little or no significance at all to the proper functioning of\nthe transaction in question, the likelihood for unlawfulness is higher. N.B. Besides, for Art.73 to be applicable, it is not required that the superior should be a high-\nranking official or military commander. It rather suffices that he/she should be of a higher rank\nthan the person executing the order, i.e. he/she should have the right to give orders and that his\nsubordinate should have corresponding duty to obey. What is the Responsibility of the Subordinate?  The Ethiopian criminal law and many other modern criminal laws take an intermediary\nposition by combining obedience with independence.  Thus, Art.74 (1) provides that the subordinate cannot escape punishment if he/she carries out\nan illegal order, which he is aware of it.  In general, under Art.74, the subordinate who has carried out an order to commit an offense\nshall be liable to punishment on the following three conditions:\na. When the subordinate is aware of the illegal nature of the order, (superior is not allowed\nby law to give an order of the type in question.) b. When the subordinate knows that the order is given without authority, (where one obeys\nan order from someone else to whom he does not owe obedience.) or\nc. When the subordinate knows the criminal nature of the act ordered,\nN.B. For the application of Art.74, the definite knowledge of the illegality of the order and\nunlawfulness of the act is required, and mere suspicious or negligence is not sufficient. The\nsubordinate is liable only when obedience is not the result of a mistake of fact or the mistake of\nlaw. 2.1.2. Necessity and Legitimate Defense: Arts.75-76\nWhat is necessity?  A necessary act is an act performed in a so critical situation that the doing of harm is the only\nalternative to the suffering of harm.  The rule for the defense of necessity is similar to that of legitimate defense. In fact in cases of\nnecessity the threat to the actor comes from nature. It is sometimes called an “act of God,” and\nit may be a fire, a storm, and an earthquake, or a shipwreck that compels the actor to do\nsomething that otherwise would be illegal.",

What is the scope of necessity defense?  The second paragraph of Art.75 provides for an exception where necessity is not a defense\nnotwithstanding that all the necessary conditions to raise the defense is met.  The law stipulates that persons who have special professional duty to protect life or health may\nbe entitled to mitigation but cannot invoke necessity.  Accordingly, if a given boat has some passengers in excess of its carrying capacity and as the\nresult is about to be drowning, except for the crewmembers that are necessary to navigate the\nboat, others must be sacrificed first.  Thus, in cases of such special circumstances the rule is danger and safety is the exception. The professionals are therefore there to protect others from the danger even at the expense\nof their lives. What are the essential elements and conditions for claiming necessity defense? The defense of necessity is not available unless some basic requirements, which are enumerated\nbelow are not satisfied. It is true that, whichever of the conditions below is missing; the justification\nof necessity may not be invoked. a. There must be a Danger: A person is not justified on the ground of necessity merely\nbecause he is objectively in a situation involving serious and imminent danger. Instead, a\nnecessary act is an intentional act. That means whatever he does in such a situation is not\njustifiable unless he does it with a view of avoiding this danger. The expression, ‘to protect’\nunder Art.75 implies that the act has to be performed with the sole objective of averting\nthe imminent danger. The accused must honestly believe, on reasonable grounds, that he\nwas placed in a situation of imminent peril. b. The Danger must be Imminent:  The danger must be reasonably certain to eventuate. There shall be no time to resort to a third choice that can be used to avoid the danger. Necessity is therefore a defense only if the law is violated when there is no hope to exploit\nor other way outs. c.  The Danger must be Serious:  the justification of the defense is based, among other\nthings, on the proportionality that must exist between the danger averted and the interest\nmade sacrifice.",

But, on the other hand, the very word “danger” implies that\nthe harm with which the actor or the person for whose benefits he acts is threatened must\namount to more than a simple inconvenience. d. The Danger Could Not Otherwise Be Averted: the doer must fall in a situation which\nthe danger cannot be avoided except by infringing upon someone else’s rights. There shall\nexist no possibility of resolving the conflict between the two interests by acting in\naccordance with the law. N.B.  Unlike a person acting in legitimate defense, a person who is in a state of necessity does not\nhave proper right to cause harm. Therefore a person in a state of necessity is not justified, unless\nthe doing of harm is absolutely necessary in the circumstances. If he can protect his interest or\nthose of another person without breaking the law or can reasonably be expected not to protect\nthem, he may not invoke Art.75. e. The Harm must be Proportional:\n When causing harm is the only way to avoid danger, the doer is justified only if he does not\ncause more harm than he would have suffered had he refrained from acting. f. Absence of fault: Under Art.76 of the code, it is provided that the defense of necessity\nceases to exist if the emergency situation is created by the fault of the actor. Therefore, the\nabsence of fault on the side of the doer is another requirement to avail himself of the\ndefense of necessity. For instance, a person driving at an excessive speed cannot raise\nnecessity as a defense if he runs over a pedestrian to save the passengers in the car. 2.1.3. Legitimate Defense: Arts. 78, 79\nWhat is legitimate defense?  It is when a person is suddenly faced with an attack to his person or property and immediate\naid from the state machinery is not available, that person is entitled to defend himself and resist\nthe attack and to inflict on the attacker any harm that is necessary for the purpose of defense.  Legitimate defense is one specific type of necessity, and therefore has much in common.

    "text": "Some of the differences are as follows:\na. \nnecessity is basically one of aggression (violence) while an act under Art 78 is one of\ndefense,\nb. \nThe doer of a necessary act, unlike a person who defends himself, is not resisting an\nunlawful assault. c. \nIn the case of necessity the conflict occurs is between two legitimate interests but in the\ncase of legitimate-defense the conflict occurs is not between two legitimate interests. This\nentails that in the first case it is strength, while in the second case it is the law, which has\nthe last word. What are the essential Conditions Required for the legitimate Defense?  The right to repulse attacks, which are contrary to the law, is not unrestricted. Its exercise is\ngoverned by the following conditions. a. There must be an Imminent Attack or a Threat of Attack:\n As its very name indicates, legitimate defense necessarily implies attack or at least a threat of\nan attack.  As with necessity, so with legitimate defense, the justification is available only insofar as\nthere exists a state of actual danger, whether the attack is in the course of being executed or\nis imminent.  It follows that there is no right of defense when either the attack has already taken place or\nthe doer seeks to prevent a future danger from eventuating. When legitimate defense shall commence?  The right of legitimate defense commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to\na legitimate interest arises from an attempt threat to commit the offense though the offense\nmay not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger\ncontinues.  The person shall not expect until some harm are caused against him. b. The Attack, Whether Actual or Imminent, Must be Unlawful:\n For the purpose of Art.78, the act done or intended to be done by the aggressor should be\nobjectively contrary to the law. Whatever this law may be, and it is not required that it should\namount to a criminal offence nor, when it amounts to such an offence, that it should be\npunishable.  The reason behind this solution is that the defender cannot be expected to know or has no time\nto find out whether the aggressor is, subjectively, at fault. For whom legitimate defense is allowed?  It is available only to those who in the face of imminent peril act in good faith.",

    "text": "The right is not\nto be allowed to be pleaded or availed of as a pretext for a vindictive, aggressive or retributive\npurpose.  The right is available against an offense and so an aggressor cannot claim the right of legitimate\ndefense. The right cannot be used as a shield to justify an act of aggression. In other words,\nthere is no private defense against private defense. c.  No other Choice  (Could Not Have Been Otherwise Averted):\n Art.78states that an act of defense “shall not be punishable if the attack or imminent attack\ncould not have been otherwise averted”. Therefore, the defense, as a rule, is not legitimate if\nthe threatened right could have been effectively protected by some means. d. The act of Defense should be Proportionate:\n The right of private defense in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary\nto inflict for the purpose of defense. The force which a person is entitled to use must not be\nunduly disproportionate to the injury which is to be averted or which is necessarily\napprehended and must not exceed its legitimate purpose, and that the exercise must not be\nvindictive or malicious.  The proportionately condition implies that regard must not only be to the respective importance\nof the interests involved, but also to elements such as the weapons, if any, used in the attack\nand the defense, and the respective sex, age, strength or state of health of the aggressor and the\ndefender. What should be the sources of danger?  It is immaterial form whom the assault emanates. The right of legitimate defense is also\navailable against an offence committed by a person who might not be criminally liable for his\nact, either by reason of the doer being a man of unsound mind, or because of want of maturity\nof understanding, or by the reason of any misconception on the part of that person. Whose and what Rights Protected?  Legitimate defense exists against attacks endangering any right, i.e. any interest is protected\nby law, such as life, bodily integrity, honour, sexual liberty or property.  It is irrelevant whether the right protected is that of the defender or of another person, and also\nwhether it is of a private or public nature. The holder of the right can be anyone. When there exist Excess in Self-Defense?  Under Art.79, the defender is deemed to exceed the limits of legitimate defense in the following\ntwo conditions:\na. Uses disproportionate means. (",

    "text": "Want of proportionality requirement): What Art.79 (1)\nactually implies, is that an act of defense is not lawful when the defender causes more harm\nthan that which he had reason to fear, i.e. when the defense is, “manifestly excessive”\nb.

Strictly speaking, therefore, he no\nlonger defends himself, as he is no longer in danger. 2.1.4. Mistake of Fact, Mistake of Law and Ignorance of law:  Arts.80&81\nA. Mistake of fact\nWhat the Meaning of ‘Fact’:\n A “fact” within the meaning of Art.80 is any event, circumstance or quality of a material of\npersonal nature the existence or non-existence of which affects the court’s decision on guilt\nand /or sentence.  A fact may consists of a phenomenon perceptible by the sense. ( e.g. the doer mistakes\narsenic for sugar) or  a state of mind (e.g. the doer believes that someone intends to kill him)\nIs the mistake of the person concerns him or the status of the person is relevant?  It is immaterial for the purposes of Art.80, whether the fact as to which the doer is mistaken\nconcerns him personally or not. For example, he marries believing himself to be a widower or\nhe has sexual intercourse with a woman whom he believes to be unmarried.  It is also immaterial whether the existence or non-existence of the fact is conditional upon the\npossession of certain legal status or the existence of a certain legal relationship (e.g. quality of\nbeing a public servant, or the owner of some property, or the relative of some person). When Mistake of Fact May be Invoked (Applicable)?  According to Art. 80 of the criminal code, a person who commits an offence in consequences\nof erroneous appreciation of the true facts of the situation must be tried as though the situation,\nwhich he believes to exist, did actually exist. Art 58 (3) of the criminal code supports this rule.  Article 80 therefore may be invoked on the following cases:\na. When the doer is mistaken as to a fact, which is a material ingredient of an offence. If\nA, after shooting B with the intention of killing him, buries him in the belief that he is dead,\nbut B is still alive and actually dies of suffocation.",

This Article excuses a person who has done what by law is\nan offence, under a misconception of facts, leading him to believe in good faith that he was\ncommanded by law to do it. A, an officer of a Court of justice, being ordered by that court\nto arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no\noffence. c.

In this case, A is not liable\nto the aggravated punishment as he dose not know of the fact in consequences of which the\npenalty is increased, namely the special status the victim has.

Intentional guilt, even if it is to be excluded in relation to a given offense, may be presented in\nrelation to a different offence, as is the case, for instance when concurrent offences are\ncommitted.

Mistake of this kind are\nsometimes referred to as non-fundamental mistakes, in opposition to fundamental or essential\nmistakes which are the only ones that which Art.80 is concerned with.  The principle laid down in Art.80 (3) is however, applicable only when the mistake as to the\nidentity of the victim or the object of the offence is without the influence of the actor’s guilt. Thus, A is not guilty of incest when he has sexual intercourse with Miss B who, unknown to\nhim, is his second cousin whom he never saw before in his life; nor is he guilty of intentional\ntheft when he takes B’s coat, believing it to be his own, or of aggravated theft when he steals\nan object which, unknown to him, is a religious one.  However, the following acts are not included; ‘A’ waits near B’s house with intention of\nshooting him when he comes home. Seeing someone approaching the house, he shoots C\nthinking that it is B C. In this case, A is guilty of intentional homicide and he cannot invoke\nArt.80. Since the identity of human being one kills is not an ingredient of the offense of\nhomicide.   ‘A’ steals a painting, which is unknown to him, but which is a mere copy of the one, he intends\nto steal. In this case, A is guilty of intentional theft and cannot invoke Art.80. B. Mistake of Law and Ignorance of Law:\n Mistake from the point of view of the law in a criminal case is no defense. Mistake of law\nordinarily means mistake as to the existence of any law on a relevant subject as well as mistake\nas to what the law is.  The maxim ignorntia juris non excusat, in its application to criminal offences, admits of no\nexception, not even in the case of a foreign who can not reasonably be supposed in fact to know\nthe law of the land.  The legal presumption that everyone knows the law of the land is often untrue as a matter of\nfact but the reason for this seems to be nothing but expediency, otherwise there is no knowing\nof the extent to which the excuse of ignorance of law might be carried.  Ignorance of the law has rarely been sufficient to excuse criminal conduct.",

What are the propositions of Schools of Law Regarding the Rule of Ignorance of Law is No\nExcuse?  The question of whether mistake of law and ignorance of law is excusable has been a\ncontroversial issue for a long time. With regards to this question, there are two main schools\nof thought. a. The first school supports the general rule: that states “Ignorance of Law is no\nExcuse.”  An offender is not justified by his unawareness or misconception of a legal provision. Whether\nor not he actually knows the law is immaterial for he is in any event conclusively presumed to\nknow it.  This presumption will make the courts free from ascertaining whether the offender knows his\nact is contrary to the law or not which is almost impossible. Thus, “Every person must be\ntaken to be cognizant of the law; otherwise there is no knowing to what extent the excuse of\nignorance might be carried”. For purposes of criminal liability, therefore, it is irrelevant\nwhether the doer is aware of the unlawfulness of his act or not. b. The second school supports an exception to the general rule and states: “Ignorance of\nLaw May be an Excuse in Certain Circumstances”\n According to this school of thought, the maxim “ignorance of law is not an excuse” It is not\nacceptable on the following grounds:\ni. The complexities of modern life and the consequent increase in the volume of laws, makes\nit completely impossible for anyone to know the laws, be it be the laws of his own country,\nlet alone to understand them. iii. It is inconsistent with the principle “nulla poena sine culpa” (no penalty without\nintentional guilty) upon which so many modern codes, including Ethiopian criminal\ncode, are based. What is the position of Ethiopia?  \nAccording to Art.81 (2) and (3) It stands in a half way in such a manner that the Ethiopian\npenal law may reduce the punishment or a one who is in good faith believed that he had a right\nto act and had definite and adequate reasons for holding this erroneous belief and may not\npunish a person who out of absolute and justifiable ignorance and good faith and without\ncriminal intent commits a crime.  \n \nWhat are the essential elements to apply art 81? a. When there is Good Faith Article 81 may not be invoked unless, at the time of the act,\nthe doer in good faith believes that he is legally entitled to act as he does.",

( see art 88)\nExplain the different forms of punishment?  The Criminal Code carefully designs and prescribes punishments for crimes of various kinds\nand criminals of various categories. Thus, there are three different sets of punishments under\nthe code. a. Ordinary punishments applicable to Adults –Book II, Title I, Articles 90-156. b. Measures and penalties applicable to young persons-Book II, Title I Articles 57-177\nc. Penalties and measures applicable to Petty offences-Petty Code, Book VII Title II\nArticles 746-764.

The major grounds for this argument are:\nAn execution, just like torture, involves a deliberate assault on a prisoner. Even so-called\n'humane' methods such as lethal injection can entail excruciating suffering. Capital punishment is irrevocable. All judicial systems make mistakes, and as long as the\ndeath penalty persists, innocent people will be executed.

In case of fully or partially irresponsible or seriously ill persons or a pregnant woman. ii. The death sentence may be commuted to “Rigorous Imprisonment for Life”, in case of a\nwoman with child and if she gives birth to a live child. iii. The other cases of sentences of death may be commuted or remitted only by way of pardon\nor amnesty as provided by the Arts. 229 and 230 of the Criminal Code. B. Secondary Penalties\nWhen secondary punishments are imposed?  A court may impose a secondary penalty on a criminal in addition to the primary punishment. Secondary penalties are not equal to primary punishment.  Thus, before imposing a secondary penalty the court has to pronounce a primary penalty, which\nit deems to be appropriate for a crime. However, they may replace the principal penalty under\nthe conditions stated by the provision of article 122(2). If such is specifically laid down by the law; or\nWhere there are extenuating circumstances; or\nWhere the law provides for a free mitigation of the punishment (article 82 &83);  or\nWhere enforcement of the sentence is postponed. Is the court obliged to always impose secondary penalties in addition to primary penalties? The court is not obliged. The law gives the discretion whether or not to impose\nsecondary penalties to the court under article 122(2). What are the types of secondary penalties? There are different types of secondary penalties. These are:\na. Caution (warning), Admonishment: (expression of disapproval of ones actions or\nbehavior), Reprimand (strong official disapproval of someone) and Public apology\n(Article. 122 (1)\nb. Deprivation of rights (Art.123) They could be permanent or temporary (6 month to 5\nyears) deprivation of  Civil rights, Family rights,  and The right to exercise a profession\nC. Special Measures Applicable to Adults:\nWhy we call them special?  Measures may be imposed even if they are not specifically indicated in the Special Part of the\nCode as far as the court finds it to be desirable keeping in view the purposes of the criminal\nlaw. What are the different forms special measures?  Our code has three categories of measures. These are dealt with as follows:\na.  Measures applicable Irresponsible persons and criminals with limited responsibility:\nThese are the measures of confinement and treatment. See articles 130(1), and 131. b. General Measures for the Purposes of Prevention and Protection: These types of\nmeasures are applied together with principal penalties when the circumstances of the case\njustify them in the opinion of the court.",

Suspension of Penalty and Conditional Release:  Art. 190\ni. \nSuspension of Penalty\nWhat is suspension of penalty and why?  The principle of conditional suspension of penalty is for the promotion of the reform and\nreinstatement of the criminal by giving him room to help himself in his own reformation.  There are two kinds of suspension of penalties under the Criminal Code. These are:\na. Suspension of Pronouncement of Penalty, Art. 191\n The court suspends the sentence and places the offender on probation after conviction. “Probation is a sentence served in the community without confinement in the prison, under\nthe supervision of a probation officer and conditional upon strict obedience to the rules\nestablished by the courts.” What are Essential Conditions for Suspension of Pronouncement of Penalty? Art. 191\nThe criminal  must not have any previous conviction i.e. he must be a first offender,\nHe should not appear to be of dangerous character,\nThe crime he is convicted of should be punishable only with fine, Art. 90 compulsory\nlabour, Art. 103 and 104\nSimple imprisonment for less than 3 years, Art. 106\nb. Suspension of Enforcement of Penalty, Art. 192\n The court convicts the criminal, passes an appropriate sentence and promptly records such\nconviction.  But, simultaneously, the court also gives an order suspending the enforcement of the penalty\nfor a specified period of probation. For example, if the criminal is sentenced to one year simple\nimprisonment, it will be recorded but he will not be imprisoned. ii. Conditional Release: Art. 201\nWhen and why conditional release are granted?  This is provided towards the end of the enforcement of the penalty. This provision may be\napplied in all cases where a penalty or measure resulting in ‘loss of liberty’ is imposed.  Conditional release also is base on the consideration that it serves as a means of reform and\nsocial reinstatement. Further, conditional release should be adopted only in cases where it\naffords a reasonable chance of success. What are the Essential Conditions for ‘Conditional Release? Art. 202\n The court may order for the conditional release of the prisoner basing on the recommendation\nof the Prison Director when the conditions listed under art 202 are fulfilled.

B. Pardon and Amnesty: Articles. 229 and 230\nWhat is pardon?  Pardon may be defined as “the act or instance of officially nullifying punishment or other\nlegal consequences of crime”. The chief executive of a government usually grants a pardon. The president has the sole power to issue pardons. What is amnesty?  Amnesty is also a species of pardon but applies to a certain classes of criminals and specific\ntype of crimes only. Thus, it means, “a pardon extended by the government to a group or\nclass of persons usually for a political offense; the act of a sovereign power officially\nforgiving certain classes of persons who are subject to trail but have not yet been convicted.  Unlike an ordinary pardon, amnesty is usually addressed to crimes against state sovereignty\ni.e. to political offences with respect to which forgiveness is deemed more expedient for the\npublic welfare than prosecution and punishment.  Amnesty is usually general, addressed to classes or even communities, which also termed as\n‘general pardon’. If so what is the Differences between Pardon and Amnesty? a. Pardon is remittance of penalty while amnesty is a general pardon especially for political\ncrimes against government. b. Pardon is granted by the competent authority where as amnesty is granted by the\nappropriate competent authority. c. In pardon, the remission of sentence may be whole or in part and in amnesty, it is always\ncomplete remission. d. Pardon may completely remit the penalty or commute the same to a penalty of lesser nature\nor gravity. e. Pardon may apply to all penalties and measures whether principal or secondary. But\namnesty may be granted in respect to certain crimes and certain classes of criminals only\nf. The order of pardon may determine the conditions to which it is subjected to and its scope. Amnesty may be either absolute or subject to certain conditions and obligations. g. Pardon shall not cancel the sentence. The entry of sentence shall remain in the judgment\nregister of the criminal and continue to produce its other effects. However, amnesty,\ncancels both the indictment and the sentence and bars or discontinues any prosecution from\nthe moment of its promulgation.",

If the convict who satisfies the requirements prescribed by law is incapable of acting\nby himself or has died, the request may be made by his legal representative or a next-\nof-kin. What are the Conditions for Reinstatement? Article 233\n Reinstatement shall be granted by the Court subject to the conditions enumerated under art\n233. Discuss on the contemporary Systems of Determination of Penalty:\nA. System of Discretionary Penalties:\n This system was applied in Pre- Revolutionary French law. The penalty is not determined by\nthe law; the judge establishes it taking into account the particular circumstances under which\nthe crime was committed and the personality if the criminal. He may, for instance, take into\naccount the background of the criminal, his general character, the reasons for which the crime\nwas committed, etc.   This system would allow the penalty to be fitted to the guilt of the criminal, to the possibilities\nof his reform or, as we would say today to, the needs of “social rehabilitation”. It has, on the\nother hand, the disadvantage of tending towards the arbitrary and of weakening of the\nintimidation value of the penalty. B. The System of Fixed Penalties:\n This system is adopted by the legislators of the French Revolutionary period which consists in\nthe legislative determination of the penalty to be applied to the crime without any possible\nmodification designed to fit the personality of the criminal.  This system has the advantage of being strongly deterrent and therefore of maintaining the full\nintimidation value of the penalty. However, it has the disadvantage of being unjust and even\nineffectual by not allowing the penalty to be fitted to the crime committed by the criminal and\nhis chances to reform.",

    "text": "FAMILY LAW\nTEACHING MATERIAL\n0\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nINTRODUCTION\nBoth men and women who have attained marriageable age can marry and found a family. This is\na constitutionally recognized right of individuals. Family law is one of the areas of law that is\nbeing transformed quickly. Particularly, the rights of women in marriage are of paramount\nimportance when the dynamic nature of the law of family is considered. The recognition of the\nequal rights of women in owning and administering property in marriage and the rights of\nwomen during divorce have been the focal points in the transformation of family law. The Federal Government has issued the Revised Family Code (FRC) in the Proclamation No. 213/2000. The new family law tried to resolve the age-old problems of married women so that,\nrights recognized in the FDRE Constitution and international agreements be included in the\nfamily law. Yet, it cannot be said that the treatment of the RFC is complete. Emerging rights,\nsuch as reproductive and sexual rights of women are not addressed by the RFC, although they\nare partially recognized by the FDRE Constitution. The RFC is believed to set standards for the family laws that are to be enacted by the Regional\nStates where the 1960 Civil Code is still in force. Regional States are expected to enact their\nown family laws based on the peculiar conditions of each Regional State, without violating the\nconstitutional rights of individuals, particularly of women. One Regional State, that is the Tigray\nRegional State enacted its own family code before the Federal State has made the RFC. After\nthe advent of the RFC two Regional States, the Amhara and Oromia Regional States have made\ntheir respective family codes. The Oromia Family Code, although adopted by the Oromia\nCouncil, it has not yet appeared in the official gazette of the State. Therefore, when reference to\n1\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nthe Oromia Family Code is made anywhere in this material, note has to be made that the Oromia\nFamily Code was not promulgated in the Negarit Gazette of the State. The Southern Region is\npreparing its regional family code. The family codes of the three regional states have no great\ndepartures from the RFC, except on some points. The main differences are highlighted in this\nmaterial. This teaching material is prepared by following the methods that are relevant to teach especially\nadult students. Almost all of the articles of the RFC are briefly explained in a plain language. The explanations are followed by exercises.",

    "text": "It is a\nlegal status, condition, or relation of a man and a woman united in law for life, or until divorced,\nfor discharge to each other and the community of the duties legally incumbent on those whose\nassociation is favored on the distinction of sex. The word \"family\" is more of sociological than\nlegal. You might have encountered different meanings to the word family. We may divide\nfamily into four types:\ni) \nThe nuclear family,\nii) \nThe compound family,\niii) \nThe joint family, and\niv) \nThe extended family\nNuclear family. The term “nuclear family” (or “elementary,” “simple,” or “basic”) is most\nfrequently used to refer to a group consisting of a man, a woman, and their socially recognized\nchildren. It refers to the concrete groups, and the qualification “nuclear” suggests that this is a\nunit out of which more extensive family groups are built or grow. Compounded family. The term “compounded family” is used to refer to a concrete group\nformed thorough the amalgamation of nuclear-family units or parts of them. A polygamous\nhousehold consisting of one man, his two or three wives, and their respective children would\nconstitute a compound family. Joint family. A joint family exists when “two or more lineally related kinsfolk of the same sex,\ntheir spouses and offspring, occupy a single homestead and are jointly subject to the same\nauthority or single head.” Extended family. An extended family is a dispersed version of the joint family. That is,\nmembers of the constituent groups of an extended family do not all live together in one dwelling. They usually live close together and engage in common activities. 4\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nFrom functional point of view, the family is the one social system that all societies look to for the\nreplacement of their members. However, from the structural point of view, the word “family” is\nused to refer not only to the marital couple and their children but also to the larger kin group. The new family code has introduced several changes to the country's family law. One of the\nareas of change concerns the equality of sexes in marriage. In the Revised Family Code (RFC)\nthe husband and the wife are given equal right and equal power in the management of their\nhousehold.",

    "text": "There are also other major changes with which we are going to deal in due course. Marriage is one of the sources of family. Marriage is a very important institution in which the\nspouses take responsibility to respect, assist and support each other and up bring their children. The state gives special attention to marriage since marriage is an institution through which the\nfamily; which is the natural and fundamental unit of the society is established. Men and women\nare complementary and interdependent. In order to survive, men need women, and women need\nmen. Marriage is the legal institution, which expresses the interdependence of men and women. Marriage is a social and economic partnership, which ideally allows a man and a woman to\nflourish together. Marriage is also a partnership for the raising and nurturing of children. Because men and women depend upon one another, and because children depend on their\nparents, it is important for the law to specify the respective rights and obligations of family\nmembers. Thus, although in some way marriage is a private matter in which the government will\nnot interfere, in other ways marriage is a matter of public concern which the government\nregulates its administration by law. The RFC does not define the word marriage. But from the understanding of the provisions of the\nCode we can derive a working definition for marriage. We can define it as follows:\n“Marriage is a special contract of permanent union between a man and a woman entered into in\naccordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and family life. It is the foundation of the\nfamily and an inviolable social institution whose nature, consequences, and incidents are\ngoverned by law.” 5\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nFrom this definition, it can be seen that marriage is a solemn contract which the parties cannot\ndissolve as they please. A contract is an agreement, freely entered into between two people,\nwhich affects their rights and obligations and which the state will recognize and enforce through\nthe legal system. Although marriage is a type of contract, unlike other contracts, the parties\ncannot simply dissolve it as they please. Rather, the parties can only terminate their marriage\naccording to specific rules and procedures contained in the law. Thus, in addition to being a\ncontract, marriage is a lasting relationship which endures until it is terminated either by death of\none of the spouses or by the declaration of his/her absence or by order of the court or by divorce.",

    "text": "Because marriage is a serious commitment which will determine the future rights and obligations\nof the husband and wife, it is important that both parties have the capacity at the time they enter\nthe marriage to understand and consent to the commitment which they undertake. The\ngovernment thus has a strong interest in regulating the formation of marriage. In this particular chapter you will learn about the conclusion of marriage, that is, the procedures\nthrough which marriage is concluded. In Ethiopia celebrating marriage through various ways is\nallowed. This is not the case in some other countries. Some countries allow only civil marriage, a\nmarriage that is celebrated before the officer of civil status. There are three forms of celebration\nof marriage that are recognized by the Ethiopian family law. All the three forms of marriage\nshall be celebrated by fulfilling the conditions for the validity of marriage. Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n Explain the differences between the various kinds of marriage;\n Enumerate essential conditions that are common to all forms of marriage;\n Discuss such conditions in relation to the sanctions entailed if such conditions are not\nfulfilled;\n Discuss the personal and pecuniary effects of marriage;\n Discuss the various causes of dissolution of marriage;\n6\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n Demonstrate how the existence of marriage will be proved;\n Identity the differences and similarities between marriage and irregular union;\n Illustrate the changes introduced by the Revised Family Code; and\n Solve imaginary and real legal problems by applying the law. Throughout this chapter, your study must be based on these objectives. As you progress in your\nstudy, you must think that how much you have achieved them. Marriage is a special contract concluded between two persons of opposite sex. There are\nvarious forms in which marriages are celebrated. Irrespective of their forms, however, all types\nof marriage produce similar effects. That is, although there are different ways by which\nmarriages are concluded, once they are concluded all marriages that are concluded and\ncelebrated with different formalities will be treated at equal footing. 1.1. Forms of Marriage. Marriage is celebrated in various forms. The law equally recognizes marriages celebrated in\ndifferent formalities. Study Articles 1-5 of the Revised Family Code. Exercise\n1. How many forms of marriage do we have? 2. What differences do you see between civil marriage and religious marriage? 3. What differences do you see between civil marriage and customary marriage?",

    "text": "According to Article1 of the RFC, there are three forms of marriage. These are:\n \nCivil Marriage\n7\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n \nReligious Marriage\n \nCustomary Marriage\n1.1.1. Civil Marriage\nFrom Article 2, you may have noted that civil marriage is the one that is celebrated before the\nofficer of civil status. From the wording of the law, it is clear that only heterogeneous type\nmarriage is allowed in Ethiopia. Moreover, the law requires that the man and the woman must\nphysically appear before the officer of civil status and give their respective consent. Exercise\nWho is the officer of civil status? The officer of civil status is an officer who registers vital events such as births, deaths,\nmarriages, divorces, and adoptions. The status of birth, death, marriage, divorce and adoption\nare generally called the civil status. One of the most important elements in the conclusion of marriage is the consent of the future\nspouses. Exercise\nWhat do you think is consent of future spouses? The following provision is extracted from the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE)\nConstitution. Article 34(2)\nMarriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. 8\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nAs you can clearly see from the above article from the FDRE Constitution, marriage must be\nconcluded on the basis of the free will and volition of the man and the woman. If, for instance, a\ngirl or a woman is forced to marry a certain man she does not want to marry, there is no consent\non the part of the girl or the woman. Exercise\n1. What do you think is the consequence of the absence of consent? 2. What is your opinion on arranged marriage and marriage by abduction? 1.1.2. Religious Marriage\nThe second form of marriage is religious marriage. Exercise\nIs marriage between persons of different religions prohibited? Religious marriage is a marriage that will be celebrated in accordance to the rites (ceremonies)\nof:\n The religion of both future spouses, or\n The religion of one of the future spouses. You must note here that the manners of celebrations of marriages could differ according to the\nrules of the respective religion. The law is not interested in the details of the rites of each\nreligion. 1.1.3. Customary Marriage\nThe third form of marriage is customary marriage.",

    "text": "Customary marriage is celebrated in\naccordance with one of the following:\n9\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n Custom of the community in which both spouses live, or\n Custom of the community to which they belong, or\n Custom of the community to which one of them belongs. Just as in religious marriage, the formalities of celebration of customary marriage differ from\ncustom to custom. While marriage celebrations in all civil marriages follow similar procedures,\nthe procedures followed in religious and customary marriages vary from religion to religion and\nfrom culture to culture. In addition to the above forms of marriage, marriages celebrated outside Ethiopia are accepted as\nvalid marriage if they conform to the Ethiopian laws and public moral. In one case, (Civil Case\nFile No.972/90) a marriage between Dr. Ashagre Yigletu and Wro. Marta Tangel, which was\nconcluded in Yugoslavia, was treated as though it was concluded in Ethiopia and family\narbitrators decided its divorce by applying Ethiopian law. The Federal First Instance Court\napproved the divorce according to the Ethiopian law, even if the marriage was concluded outside\nEthiopia. Exercise\nIf country \"X\" has a law that allows marriage between similar sexes, do you think such\nmarriage be valid in Ethiopia? Why / Why not? 1.2. Essential Conditions of Marriage\nIn this section, you will study the conditions that are necessary for the validity of a marriage. The marriage is said to be defective, unless the essential conditions are fulfilled. The conditions\nmust be fulfilled by all marriages irrespective of the formality in which the marriage is\ncelebrated. 10\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nRead Articles 6-16 of the Revised Family Code\n1.2.1. Consent. Both the man and the woman who are married to each other must give their consent to the\nmarriage. The consent must be free and full. In Civil Case File № 55/92, Wro. Se‟ada Hassen\napplied to the Arba Minch Zuria Woreda Court claiming that she concluded marriage without her\nconsent by the imposition of her father Hajji Hassen Delil. She argued that the marriage\nagreement was concluded between her father and her husband without her consent by violating\nArt 34(2) of the FDRE Constitution and the provisions of the Civil Code. Her husband, Ato\nEshetu Mohammed responded that, the marriage between him and the plaintiff was concluded\naccording to the rules of their religion and that cannot violate the Civil Code. Consent is one of\nthe very essential conditions of marriage even in the Civil Code.",

    "text": "Exercise\nIf you were the judge at that court, what would be your decision for the above case? In the Civil Code there is the idea of betrothal, which is not included in the RFC. Betrothal,\nunlike marriage, is concluded between the family members of the future spouses. Betrothal may\nbe practiced in the countryside of some parts of Ethiopia, even today. However, it also requires\nthe consent of the future spouses. Today in urban areas, betrothal is almost non-existent. But\nthat does not mean that people are prohibited from concluding betrothal. They can conclude\nbetrothal contracts, although there is no mechanism of handling disputes that may arise out of\nbetrothal. In the Tigray Family Code, which was enacted before the enactment of the RFC and in the\nAmhara and Oromia Family Codes, betrothal was retained. There is a basic difference between\nbetrothal in these three codes and betrothal in the Civil Code of 1960. That is, betrothal in the\nCivil Code was a contract between the family members of the future spouses. But in these\ncodes, it is a contract concluded between the future spouses themselves. It must be noted here\n11\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nthat in the Civil Code also consent of the future spouses to the contract of betrothal was a\nrequirement. The marrying spouses must give their consent voluntarily. If consent is extorted by force or by\ncompulsion, such consent is a defective one. A defective consent results in a defective marriage. The use of violence/force to compel may not be limited to the victim alone. As you read in\nArt.14 (2) consent is deemed to be extorted by violence where it is given by a spouse to protect\nhimself/herself (the victim) or one of his/her ascendants or descendants, or any other close\nrelative from a serious and imminent danger or threat of danger. Exercise\n1. What is serious and imminent danger or threat of danger? 2. What will happen to the marriage if it is concluded irrespective\nof a defective consent? 1.2.2. Age. The minimum age requirement for both the man and the woman is 18 years. That is, unless the\nmarrying spouses attain the age of 18 years they cannot conclude marriage. The Civil Code of\n1960 allowed girls to marry at the age of 15. According to Art.",

Exercise\n1.Why do you think it is necessary to raise marriageable age of a woman to 18 years? 2. Is there any maximum age limit to conclude marriage? There are several reasons for raising the marriageable age of women and are related to legal,\nmedical, social and economic reasons. Legally, it is believed that a person who is under the age\nof 18 is incapable of performing juridical acts. He or she cannot give a consent that is\n12\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nsustainable at law. Marriage is a juridical act. A minor is under a general incapacity to conclude\na juridical act. Moreover, minors are believed to be incapable to shoulder responsibilities that are\nassociated with marriage due to their inexperience in life. Medically, early marriage has a\nnumber of problems especially, associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Moreover, a minor\ngirl should devote her time for her education and other activities that contribute to her well-being\nand self-actualization rather than holding family and social responsibilities for which she is not\nready. Notwithstanding this, however, the law authorizes the Minster of Justice, for a serious\ncause to reduce this age by two years, if an application is made to him (Art. 7(2)). Application to\nthis end can be made to the Minster by the future spouses, the guardian of one of the spouses, or\ntheir parents. In addition, at present the population growth rate of Ethiopia is one the highest in the world. This country did not develop strong economy that could support the alarmingly increasing\npopulation number. Ethiopia should devise a mechanism to check its population growth. One of\nthe mechanisms could be raising the marriageable age of women. Exercise\nWhat do you think constitutes a “serious cause” for the Minister of Justice to reduce the\nmarriageable age by two years? All forms of marriage are required to respect this age requirement. 1.2.3. Consanguinity\nPeople who are related by consanguinity are prohibited from marrying each other. The RFC has\nnarrowed consanguinity relationship, so that cousins can marry each other. The Civil Code\nprohibited marriage between persons who are related up to the seventh generation. Prohibiting\nmarriage by counting up to seventh generation seems to be impractical for two main reasons.",

The bases for the prohibition of marriage between persons who are\nrelated by consanguinity could be for religious, moral, medical, social, etc. reasons. There are two types of consanguinity relationships. These are consanguinity in the direct line\nand consanguinity in the collateral line. In the former case, the relationship is between\ndescendants and ascendants. Whatever the distance between these persons, they cannot marry\neach other. People who are related in the collateral line are those who descend from one or more\ncommon ancestors. For instance, a brother and a sister are persons related in the collateral line. According to Article 8:\n Marriage between persons that are related by consanguinity in the direct line (that is,\nbetween ascendants and descendants) is prohibited.  Likewise a man cannot marry his sister nor can he marry his aunt; a woman is also\nprohibited from marrying her brother and her uncle.

(2) Relationship by consanguinity shall be of no effect beyond the seventh generation. 14\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThis means that people who are related up to the seventh generation cannot marry each other.

    "text": "If one or both of the spouses have children from another marriage, such children will have\nrelation of affinity on the direct line with the wife or husband of their parent. ( That is, with their\nstepparents). Thus according Art 9, Marriage is prohibited between:\n      Persons who are related by affinity in the direct line. This means: a man cannot be\nmarried to the mother of his wife; and a woman to the father of her husband. Moreover, a man is not allowed to marry the daughter of his wife begotten from\nanother marriage. Nor is a woman allowed to marry the son of her husband from\nanother marriage (i.e., her stepchild.) The same is true with other descendants and\nascendants.  Persons who are related by affinity in the collateral line. This means: a man is\nprohibited from marring the sister of his wife; a woman is not allowed to marry the\nbrother of her husband. In the Civil Code there is a concept of double affinity. But double affinity is not included in the\nRFC. Art. 554 of the Civil Code provides as follows. Art.554. — Double affinity. 16\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n(1) A bond of double affinity exists between a person and the spouse of the persons to\nwhom he is related by affinity. (2) Such bond of double affinity shall produce the same effect as a bond of simple affinity. This rule is introduced into the Tigray Family Code without any change. The Oromia Family\nCode did not consider double affinity. However, its definition of simple affinity is similar to that\nof the Civil Code. That is, according to the Oromia Family Code, a bond of affinity exists in the\ndirect line between a person and the ascendants or descendants of his spouse; and in the\ncollateral line it exists between a person and the collaterals of his spouse. The RFC has\nshortened this situation to only the man and sisters of his wife and to the woman and brothers of\nher husband. Although the Civil Code of 1960 has restricted the affinity relationship to be\neffective only up to third degree in the collateral line, there is no such a limitation in the Oromia\nFamily Code. Exercise\nDoes that mean that, affinity relationship would persist up to the seventh degree, according\nto the Oromia Family Code? The rule of double affinity establishes additional affinity relation.",

Both consanguinity and affinity relationships produce some effects. The effects may not\nnecessarily be the same. Generally, relationships give rights; they create obligations; and they\ncarry with them incapacities. Rights that emanate from relationship include; the right of\nsuccession, parental power, the right to demand supply of maintenance, etc. Obligations include;\nthe duty of parents to raise their children, the duty to supply maintenance, the obligation to\nbecome tutor/guardian of minor children, etc. Incapacities also include impossibility of marriage\nand the prohibition of occupying same office by relatives, as some offices impose on them. 17\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n1.2.5. Bigamy\nBigamy is concluding another marriage while bound by a previous marriage. For example, if\n“A” and “B” are husband and wife respectively, “A” cannot marry “C” before dissolving his\nmarriage with “B”. Bigamy is not only prohibited under the RFC (Art. 11), but also it is criminal\nunder the Penal Code. (Art. 616)\nArticle 650 – Bigamy\n1) Whoever, being tied by the bond of a valid marriage, intentionally contracts\nanother marriage before the first union has been dissolved or annulled, is\npunishable with simple imprisonment, or, in grave cases, and especially where the\ncriminal has knowingly misled his partner in the second union as to his true state,\nwith rigorous imprisonment not exceeding five years. 2) Any unmarried person who marries another he knows to be tied by the bond of an\nexisting marriage, is punishable with simple imprisonment. 3) Limitation of criminal proceedings is suspended until such time as one of the two\nmarriages shall have been dissolved or annulled. Article 651 – Exception\nThe preceding Article shall not apply where bigamy is committed in conformity with\nreligious or traditional practices recognized by law. According to the Family Code of Tigray, bigamy is prohibited. Irrespective of this prohibition,\nthe Tigray Family Code lays down an exceptional circumstance to the prohibition. That is, when\nreligious and customary marriages are celebrated in accordance with accepted practices of the\nlocality, the prohibition of bigamy under Art. 31 has no application.",

That is, the\nOromia Family Code does not consider bigamy as one of the essential conditions of marriage. People in the Oromia Regional State can conclude bigamous marriages through legal means. Exercise\nHow do you perceive the exceptional rule of the Criminal Code, the Tigray Family Code\nand the absence of bigamy prohibition in the Oromia Family Code? Discuss with friends. There are reasons for the prohibition of bigamy. Some of these include:\n The existing demographic conditions in any society of the world do not suggest bigamy. That is, unless artificial factors involve, the number of men and women in any society is\nnearly equal. This natural factor would not suggest bigamy.  Since it is men who usually allowed practicing a bigamous marriage, women‟s rights\nadvocates argue that it violates the basic rights of women. Because it is considered to be\na discriminatory practice. Moreover, since men usually practice it, it is also said that it\nwould seriously affect the property rights of women. Because to conclude another\nmarriage, the man utilizes the resources of the previous wife. Her property is taken by\nanother person.  It is believed that bigamy weakens ascendant-descendant relationship and consequently,\nfamily bonds, etc. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in its General\nRecommendation No. 21 (13th session, 1994) reported that:\nPolygamous marriages\nStates Parties’ reports also disclose that polygamy is practiced in a number of countries. Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman’s right to equality with men, and can have such\nserious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that such marriage\nought to be discouraged and prohibited.

Representation Not Allowed\nAccording to Art. 12(1) of the RFC, a marrying spouse should conclude the marriage by\nphysically appearing before the appropriate authority (the officer of civil status, religious\nauthority or customary authority), depending on the form of marriage to give his consent\npersonally. He is not allowed to delegate someone to conclude marriage on behalf of him. Although this is the rule under Article 12(1), its exception is provided for in Article 12(2).

Exercise\n1. What do you think constitutes a serious cause? 2. Can both spouses be represented if both of them have a serious cause? The law does not define or list down what really constitutes a serious cause in this matter. Apparently, whether certain cause is serious enough to allow marriage by representation is left to\nthe judgment of the Ministry of Justice.

When there is no ground for withdrawal? b. When there is a serious ground for withdrawal? Unlike the case of civil marriage, religious and customary marriages have no uniformity. Each\nreligion and custom has its own formality. SUMMARY\n23\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n There are three kinds of marriage that have been recognized by the Ethiopian law. These\nare, civil marriage, religious marriage and customary marriage. All the three types of\nmarriage are equally valid before the law.  The law tries to ensure the fulfillment of certain conditions that are considered to be the\nessential conditions of marriage. One of these essential conditions is consent. Consent is\na very important condition that has to be satisfied upon conclusion of marriage. It is\nbelieved that it is one of the fundamental human rights of individuals and the FDRE\nConstitution recognizes it. That is, according to Article 34(2) of the FDRE Constitution,\nmarriage has to be concluded with the full and free consent of the intending spouses. Not\nfulfilling this condition would entail the invalidation of the marriage. There are also other\nconditions that have to be seriously observed by those who intend to marry each other.  The law prescribes the procedures for the celebration of a civil marriage by leaving\nreligious and customary marriages. That is, the law does not say anything about how\nreligious and customary marriages shall be celebrated. The reason for this is that, there\nare so many religions and customs in the country and it is not possible for the law to\ninclude all these procedures in the law. Moreover, state and religion are different\ninstitutions and one does not interfere in the affairs of the other. CHAPTER 2\n24\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nEFFECTS OF VIOLATIONS OF ESSENTIAL\nCONDITIONS OF MARRIAGE\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the first chapter, you studied about the essential conditions of marriage.

The effects are sanctions that are imposed by law to\npunish those who did not respect the essential conditions. The sanctions vary from case to case,\ndepending on the essential condition violated. The violation of most conditions would lead to the\ninvalidation of the marriage. To get the invalidation of the marriage that is celebrated by\nviolating one of the essential conditions, an interested person must apply to the court of law. Although the marriage is concluded on violation of an essential condition, it shall be considered\nas valid marriage until the court invalidates it. This shows that, in Ethiopia there is no void\nmarriage, instead we have a voidable marriage. Objectives\nAfter completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n Explain what sanctions will be imposed when each of the essential   conditions are not\nfulfilled;\n Demonstrate the persons that can bring the case before the court claiming that an\nessential condition has been violated;\n Summarize the differences between absolute, relative and prohibitive impediments of\nmarriage;\n Display the differences between void and avoidable marriages;\n Decide on imaginary and real cases by applying the provisions of the law. 25\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n2.1  The Consequences of the Violation of Essential Conditions of\nMarriage\nAll marriages may not necessarily be concluded in a perfect way as required by the law. A\nmarriage may be defective because of unfulfillment of one or more of the essential conditions. It\nis only the court, with the exclusion of other institutions that can pass a decision on such a\ndefective marriage. If the court finds that the marriage is defective, it may invalidate it. An\nannulment or invalidation affects individual‟s personal and property rights. These rights include:\n(1) rights of children born of the relationship, (2) personal and property rights of the parties\nbetween themselves: and, (3) property rights of other third parties in relation to the man and\nwoman. However, the court may have no any alternative than invalidating the marriage, when\nsuch marriage is concluded irrespective of the existence of impediments of marriage. In most of\nthe following circumstances, the court would invalidate the marriage. 2.1.1.

As practice in these countries showed, such an action should be brought in order to\nestablish a legal record that the marriage was void. In many countries that recognize a void\nmarriage, any person can file for the annulment of the void marriage. In the past, in countries\nsuch as England and the United States, a declaration of annulment had very harsh consequences. For example, suppose that after living with a man for forty years a woman‟s marriage was\nannulled. She might not have been entitled to any alimony or support payments. Likewise,\nchildren born before the marriage was annulled would have been considered illegitimate. Today,\nthe laws of many countries seek to avoid these unfair consequences. Most modern laws offer\nprotection to people who believed they had a valid marriage. Hence a child born of a marriage\nwhich is later declared invalid shall be treated the same as a child born of a valid marriage. The\nrights and responsibilities of parents whose marriage has been annulled will be determined\naccording to the rules regarding divorce. These rights and responsibilities include child custody,\nchild support, and visitation. However, the appearance of the legitimacy, which the fact of the\ncelebration had given to the union of two persons, is retroactively destroyed by the judicial\nsentence recognizing or pronouncing the nullity. Countries that divide defective marriages as\nvoid and voidable use the gravity of the defect for such division. Serious defects such as\nmarriage between a brother and a sister would make the marriage void.",

A voidable marriage\nis also a defective marriage. But it is going to be invalidated by a court of law when application\nis made for its invalidation. Until it is invalidated by a court of law, the marriage will produce\nall legal effects of a normal marriage.

Exercise\nIf a man concludes a bigamous marriage, can we consider that marriage as being affected\nby absolute impediments? B) Relative impediments\nA marriage that is affected by relative impediments shall be susceptible to invalidation only\nwithin a certain limited period of time. Once this time elapses, no action to invalidate the\nmarriage is admitted. A marriage that is affected by a relative impediment is voidable and\nvalidatable. For example, if a girl of 17 years old concludes marriage, her marriage is a defective\none. But application to invalidate her marriage is possible only until she attains the full age of 18\nyears. After then, the law shall not allow any application for invalidation. Vice in consent and\nmarriage of a judicially interdicted person also come under relative impediments.

Other interested persons are excluded from bringing an opposition in the\nbigamy case. 1. Why do you think does the law make such differences? 2. Articles 28 - 30 require the registration of all forms of marriage by the officer of\ncivil status. What is the advantage of having the records of marriages? SUMMARY\n A marriage may be defective as a result of failure of observing the essential conditions of\nmarriage. The consequence of the unfulfillment of the essential condition would entail\nthe invalidation of the marriage by the order of the court. When the marriage is ordered\nby the court to be invalidated, it loses its legal validity. Thereafter, there will not be such\na marriage.  Although a court pronounces an order of nullity when marriage is concluded by violating\nan essential condition, the Ethiopian family law does not know a void marriage. That is to\nsay, a marriage, whatever it is defective, it is not invalid from its very inception. It\nbecomes ineffective only after its nullity is declared. Before it is nullity is declared it is\nan effective marriage. This can be well illustrated in a bigamous marriage. If a man\nmarries a second wife without dissolving the first marriage, the second marriage is a\nbigamous one and it is not a valid marriage. But here, the second marriage cannot\nautomatically be invalidated. It can be invalidated only by the order of the court. The\ncourt invalidates the second marriage upon application by an interested person. If no one\napplies for its invalidation, the marriage is equally effective as any legal marriage. In case\nthe man dies, both marriages are dissolved by the death of the man. Both women are\nconsidered wives of the deceased. 37\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n The unfulfillment of some of the essential conditions does not entail the invalidation of\nthe marriage. On the basis of this character of the essential conditions, such conditions\nare divided into three categories. These are; absolute impediments, relative impediments\nand prohibitive impediments. Absolute impediments are those, which remain forever. There is no lapse for these impediments. An application can be made for their\ninvalidation any time so long as the defective marriage is there. Relationship by\nconsanguinity is an example of such an impediment.",

CHAPTER 3\nEFFECTS OF MARRIAGE\nINTRDUCTION\nYou have already been informed in the previous chapters that marriage is a special contract that\nis going to be made between a man and a woman. Marriage produces very important effects that\n38\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nmay have legal consequences. Marriage starts to produce effects just at the moment of its\ncelebration. The effects of marriage shall not simply remain between the spouses. It also\nproduces effects on the relatives of both spouses. The effects of marriage are generally divided\ninto two. These are personal and pecuniary effects. In this chapter, you will study in detail the\ngeneral rules in relation to the effects of marriage, personal effects of marriage and pecuniary\neffects of marriage respectively. Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n Describe the essence of contract of marriage;\n Show the differences between contractual regime and the legal regime;\n Explain the difference between contract of marriage and record of marriage;\n Discuss the importance of the contract of marriage;\n Indicate which of the provisions of law are mandatory and which of them are permissive;\n Identify the differences between personal properties of spouses and their common\nproperties;\n Demonstrate the differences between properties acquired by onerous title and those not\nacquired by onerous title;\n Define the meaning of income of spouses;\n Discuss the acts of spouses in relation to their common property that require the consent\nof both spouses; and\n Indicate debts that are personal and common to both of the spouses. 3.1 General Rules of Effects of Marriage\nRead Arts. 40-48 of the RFC\n39\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nIn this section the focal point of our discussion is the meaning of contract of marriage and its\npurposes. Contract of marriage, as you will learn in this section, is a rare phenomenon in\nEthiopia. 3.1.1 Equivalence of All Forms of Marriage\nWhether the marriage is celebrated with civil, religious or customary formalities, the law does\nnot make any distinction among them with regard to the effects of marriage.",

    "text": "According to\nArticle 40, all forms of marriage produce similar effects. For instance, any income of spouses is\ntheir common property, irrespective of the fact that the marriage is celebrated in any of the three\nformalities. Community of property is one of the effects of marriage. All forms of marriage\nshall result in community of property. Spouses owe each other fidelity. This is also another\neffect of marriage that is common to all forms of marriage. 3.1.2  Consummation of Marriage\nConsummation of marriage is the sexual intercourse between the husband and the wife. According to Article 41, however, the effects of marriage shall not depend on the real or\npresumed consummation of the marriage. Exercise\nWhat is a presumed consummation of marriage? By the mere fact of cohabitation, it is presumed that the spouses consummate their marriage. If a\nman and a woman, after concluding marriage, live together but without performing sexual\nintercourse, their marriage is effective irrespective of the absence of sexual relation in marriage. You could assume that there is no maximum age limit to conclude marriage. Therefore, very old\npersons may conclude marriage. And yet they may be unable to exercise sexual intercourse. Can‟t we call them spouses? They are spouses and their marriage produces all the effects of\nmarriage. In one case, the Addis Ababa High Court  (Civil Case № 72/62) decided that the\n40\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nhusband of the mother of a child was the father of the child, although there was no sexual\nintercourse between the spouses. This shows that the marriage produces effects even without the\nconsummation of the marriage. (For more details of this case, see Chapter 9 below). Exercise\nDo you think fidelity to each other would remain as an obligation of a marriage even if one\nof the spouses is not willing to have sexual intercourse? 3.1.3   Contract of Marriage. Contract of marriage is a contract concluded between the marrying spouses before or on the date\nof their marriage. The purpose of this contract is to regulate both personal as well as pecuniary\neffects of their marriage. Exercise\nIs contract of marriage similar to record of marriage? Contract of marriage is different from record of marriage. Record of marriage is the registration\nof marriage by the officer of civil status.

    "text": "As it is known, the relationship between spouses is\nvery close and probably the closest relation when compared to other forms of relations between\nany two persons. Spouses have many personal relations, which are peculiar only to them. In this\nsection, you will study the most important personal relations of spouses. The Civil Code starts the personal effects of marriage with the provision entitled, “Head of the\nfamily.” Art. 635 of the Civil Code is read as follows:\nArt. 635. — Head of family\n(1) The husband is the head of the family. (2) Unless otherwise expressly provided by this Code, the wife owes him\nobedience in all lawful things which he orders. This rule is in direct conflict with the constitutional provision that has guaranteed equality of\nboth sexes in marriage. Article 35(2) of the FDRE Constitution provides for, “Women have\nequal rights with men in marriage as prescribed by this Constitution.” Moreover, Convention\non the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women requires that:\nArticle 16\n44\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against\nwomen in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall\nensure, on the basis of equality of men and women:\na) The same right to enter into marriage;\nb) The same right to freely choose a spouse and to enter into marriage only with\ntheir free and full consent;\nc) The same rights and responsibilities during marriage and at its dissolution; …\nBased on the FDRE Constitution and the CEDAW Convention, the RFC has eliminated the idea\nof the husband being the head of the family. Article 635 of the Civil Code was based on the\ntraditional way of life of spouses, in that only the husband was considered to be the breadwinner\nof the family. Traditionally, men work outside the house and the responsibility of wives was to\nattend household duties. The economic value of taking care of the home was never considered. In almost all societies of Ethiopia, women are not only restricted to household chores, but also\nthey are responsible to perform much of the works on the farm or on the field. In addition to\ntheir household duties, wives spend much of their time in farm works in agricultural areas and in\nthe construction of houses and fences in the pastoral areas. 3.2.1 Respect, Support and Assistance of Spouses\nExamine the following case and then answer the question given below.",

What\nadvice will you give them? According to Art. 49 spouses owe each other respect, support and assistance. This is the very\nessence of marriage. A man and a woman conclude marriage to become spouses and to shoulder\nany responsibility that is imposed on them by the law or by their agreement. The spouses are\nexpected to respect, support and assist each other. The rule that prescribes respect, support and\nassistance is a mandatory rule. Hence husband and wife are obliged to live together, observe\nmutual love, respect and fidelity, and render mutual help and support. The Oromia Family Code has included additional point on this provision. Art. 65(1) of this Code\nstipulates that, “Husband and wife have equal rights upon the conclusion of marriage, during\nmarriage and at divorce.” (Translation mine)\nExercise\nCan a spouse who leaves the common abode and lives somewhere for no good cause, have\nthe right to be supported by the common property of the spouses? 3.2.2 Management of Family Affairs\nStudy Articles 50, 51 and 52 carefully again and then give answers to the following\nexercise.

    "text": "Throughout much of the world, the legal rights of wives have been unequal when\ncompared to the legal rights of husbands. In the recent past, Ethiopian law also failed to give\nwomen equal legal rights during marriage. In the past several decades, many countries have\nrewritten their laws in an effort to give women equality with men during marriage. Ethiopia is\none of the countries that has incorporated the principle of women‟s equality into law. Many societies have found it difficult to enforce the equal rights which their constitutions and\nlaws provide. In some countries, customs and traditions make it difficult to achieve the goal of\nequality. Nevertheless it is important for the written laws to recognize that equality is one of the\ngoals of society. When the law recognizes equality as a goal, people can use the law to help\nmake the goal into reality. That is why the Ethiopian legislature has made the new family code,\nirrespective of the existence of cultural practices that are against the equality of women in\nmarriage. As Ethiopia is a federal country, it has legislative organs both at the Federal level and\nat States level. All States legislatures are expected to enact their own family laws that will clearly\nshow the equality of women with men in marriage. According to Article 50 spouses will have equal rights in the management of their family. Management of family may mean, the administration of their common property, rearing their\nchildren in a proper manner, etc. However, Art. 51 rules that if one of the souses becomes\nincapable to perform these activities, that is, if one of them is seriously sick, desert the marital\nhouse, or jailed, etc., the other spouse should perform these activities alone. Moreover, if one of\nthe spouses had a child prior to marriage, Art. 52 states that it is only the parent of the child that\nhas the right to decide with regard to matters concerning the upbringing of such child. This\nprovision is designed to limit the powers of stepfathers or stepmothers on their stepchildren.

Living together is a mandatory rule in that\nArt. 53 (3) prescribes that the spouses cannot derogate this rule in their contract of marriage.

A temporary restraining order may also require the\ndefendant to stay away from her home and place of employment. Usually the court passes this\norder against husbands who practice domestic violence on their wives. This order requires the\nman to live separately from his wife for a definite or indefinite (but relatively short) period of\ntime. 3.3 Pecuniary Effects of Marriage\nOne of the most important aspects of any marriage is how the husband and wife will regulate their\nproperty and finances. This is an issue in every society which permits private property\nownership. There are several different ways to regulate property ownership during marriage. In\nEthiopia the laws of ownership of private property are still developing. Before turning to the\nEthiopian law, let us examine some of the different ways that different countries treat property\nownership during marriage. 49\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nWhen a man and a woman marry and live together as husband and wife, questions arise as to\ntheir property rights. The husband may own property when he marries. The woman may also be\nowner of property at the time of the marriage. The family of the husband or the family of the\nwife may give a gift of money or other property to the husband or wife at the time of the\nmarriage. After the man and the woman married, they may work very hard and acquire other\nproperty. Who owns these pieces of property during the marriage? Who is responsible to\nmaintain each piece of property during the marriage? Who can sell it? In every country laws\nhave been developed to try to answer these questions about the rights and obligations of each spouse\nto own, use and take care of the property during marriage. The laws governing the property rights of a husband and a wife have varied greatly from country\nto country and from century to century. In some societies, all property of every kind, whenever\nit is acquired, is considered property owned equally by both spouses from the start of the\nmarriage. In these countries, property owned by one spouse, years before the marriage, becomes\nthe property of the husband and wife during the marriage. At the other\nextreme, in certain countries, married women do not own any property during a marriage.",

    "text": "In\nthese countries the man owns every piece of property during the marriage, and he controls its\nuse. Even if the woman owned the piece of property before the marriage, at the moment of the\nmarriage it would belong to the man. Nowadays in most countries these extremes no longer\nexist. There is a middle way where the parties can each own certain property separately and may\nalso own certain property together. As we shall discuss, Ethiopia is one of the countries that\navoids the two extremes. Another form of property relation between spouses is that, spouses will\nhave no common property. Each spouse‟s income is the personal property of that spouse. Many people agree that the most important effect of marriage is the pecuniary effect. As long as\nthe spouses live in marriage, any income will be their common property. This community of\nproperty is one of the situations that bring oneness into marriage. The law also allows personal\nproperty. But, as you will learn in this section, the law favors common property rather than\npersonal property in marriage. 50\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n3.3.1 Personal Property of Spouses\nSpouses have the right to have their own personal property in addition to their common property\nthat they own jointly.

It is true here in\nEthiopia that all property that is not specifically defined as personal property will be common\nproperty. In deciding whether property is common or personal it is helpful to first ask yourself some\nquestions about the property. Then the question whether the property is common or personal\nwill be easier to answer. Some questions to ask are:\n What is the piece of property I wish to put in the category of common property or\npersonal property?  When was this property acquired? For example, was it acquired before or during the\nmarriage?  How was this property acquired? For example, was it a gift? Was it an inheritance? Did\nhusband or wife pay money for it?

Seifu and Helen borrowed money together to buy equipment for the\nbusiness. The business increased in value till it was worth three times what its value was\nwhen Seifu inherited the business from his mother. After ten years, is it still personal or\ncommon property?

They made their applications separately and\nsucceeded in getting the certificate that proved that each was a wife. However, the pension\nauthorities refused to pay the pension allowance for both women. It ordered them to bring a\ncertificate that clearly indicates which one is the true wife of the deceased. Wro. Tenaye alleged\nthat her marriage with the deceased lasted for more than thirty years and the other woman has\nnever been wife of Ato Bekele. Because the other woman (Wro. Beletu) lived only for eight\nmonths with the deceased. She further argued that it was her name that was filled in the files of\nthe Pension Authority. Wro Beletu on her part argued that, Wro Tenaye and the deceased had\nstopped living together since fourteen years ago and hence she cannot be wife of the deceased. The Awraja Court decided that the second marriage was a bigamous and illegal marriage and it\nhas no legal effect. It recognized Wro. Tenaye Mekonnen, the only wife of the deceased, by\ndismissing Wro. Beletu. The High Court affirmed the Awraja Court decision. The Supreme\nCourt ruled that, Wro Beletu, except alleging that the deceased was not living with Wro. Tenaye,\nshe did not prove the dissolution of the previous marriage.",

    "text": "The Provisions\ndeal with the problem, which is the source of most litigation between spouses. The RFC\nprovides that common property may be sold or given away with the consent of both spouses,\notherwise it may not. However, the law does not say how each party is to express his consent. Sometimes it may be difficult to know if both spouses have given their consent. One way to\nprove that both parties consent is to require both parties to sign any papers required to sell or\ngive away the property. Some countries have this type of requirement. Study Article 68 of the RFC very carefully. According to Article 68, the agreement of both spouses is necessary to do one of the following,\neven if only one of them is empowered to administer their common property. a) To sell, exchange, rent out, mortgage or alienate in any way a common immovable\nproperty to give a right to third parties on such property. As far as common\nimmovable property is concerned, one of the spouses cannot act in any way on such\nproperty to the effect that a third party can have a right upon such immovable\nproperty. Both spouses, by their common decision, can give their common\nimmovable property to a third party, so that this third party would have a right on the\ncommon immovable property. You should note that the husband or the wife could\nnot unilaterally even rent a common property, which is immovable. b) One of the spouses alone has no power to sell, exchange, pledge or alienate in any\nother way, a common movable property or securities registered in the name of both\nspouses when the value of such properties is greater than Birr 500. Therefore, to\ntransfer a movable property the value of which is more than Birr 500, the agreement\nof both spouses is necessary. Here the purpose of the law is protecting the common\nproperties of the spouses. That is why it prohibits the transfer of any common\nimmovable property or a movable property whose value is more than Birr 500 by a\nunilateral decision of only one spouse. From this we can understand that the common\n63\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nproperty of the spouses is indivisible as long as the marriage is there. Hence, one of\nthe spouses cannot dispose of any part of the common property simply claiming that\nhe has right on the common property. c) One of the spouses is not allowed to give by way of donation any property\nthe value of which is more than Birr 100 or cash that exceeds Birr 100. d) One of the spouses cannot borrow or lend money exceeding Birr 500 by his own\nunilateral decision.",

Article 69 of the Revised Family Code deals with this issue. You may have realized from the\nreading of Art. 69 (1) that if one of the spouses enters into obligations in violation of the\nprovisions of Art. 68, the court may, at the request of the other spouse, invalidate such\nobligations. Example\n\"A\" (husband) without making an agreement with his wife \"B\", sold their common car,\nwhich was registered in the name of \"A\". He sold the car to \"Y\". Now \"B\" can apply to\nthe court to cancel the contract of sale made between \"A\" and \"Y\". The court may\ninvalidate the contract of sale. Exercise\nWhat does invalidation of a contract mean? When a contract is invalidated, the parties to the contract (“A” and “Y”) shall be, as far as\npossible, reinstated in the position which would have existed, had the contract not been made. Reinstating in the previous position means, “Y” shall return the car to “A”, and “A” shall give\n64\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nback to “Y” his money. However, you should also note Article 69 (2) has put a time limit for\nfiling an application for revoking an obligation made in violation of Article 68. In the above\nexample, for instance, “B” can bring an action to the court within six months from the date she\ncame to know of the existence of the contract. In other words, she will lose her right to bring an\naction for the invalidation of the contract. In any case, she cannot bring an action for the\ninvalidation of the contract, once two years have elapsed since the conclusion of the contract. The ideas of Art 69 of the RFC were not there in the 1960 Civil Code. As a result of this, courts\nhave no clear guideline when one spouse violates Art 658 of the Civil Code. ( Art. 658 of the\nCivil Code is the corresponding Article of Art. 68 of the RFC). By the same token, the RFC\ndoes not incorporate the possibility of objecting the occupation of one spouse by another in the\ninterest of the household.",

    "text": "The defendant in his reply said that one who claims a donation to have been made to\nhim must be in possession of the gift according to Article 2444 of the Civil Code. Alternatively,\nargued the defendant, since the money used to purchase the ticket is regarded as part of the\ncommon property of his wife and himself he cannot donate a thing which does not fully belong\nto him. Thirdly argued the defendant since the ticket is bought by money common to the couple\npursuant to Article 652 of the Civil Code, and since the benefit deriving from the ticket is not\nseparable from the ticket itself, and since he made the donation without the consent of his wife,\nthe donation is not sustainable at law in accordance with article 568 of the Civil Code. The High Court in its ruling of Tikimt 17, 1977 (E. C.). Reasoned as follows:\n67\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThough the plaintiff in this case claims that a donation of an automobile has been made to him,\nthere was no delivery effected nor a written contract entered into. (Article 2443 and 2444)  The\nautomobile was not in the hands of the defendant at the time of the making of the said donation,\nnor was it a property belonging to him (owned by him). According to Article 2451 of the Civil\nCode a donation is considered void, if the object of donation was not the property of the donor at\nthe time of the donation or if the donation is made in respect of an object which is to be acquired\nin the future. For these reasons the High Court ruled that the plaintiff‟s claim be struck-out. The appellant has in his appeal memorandum of Tikimt 26, 1977 E.C. stated his dissatisfaction\nas his grounds of appeal which, inter alia, are that:\n The appellant did not sue the respondent for an automobile donated to him, he\nsued for donation of a Tombola ticket and the automobile is the fruit of the ticket.  The ticket and the benefit deriving there-from are not separable.  It cannot be said that a Tombola ticket is not property.  The ticket with its fruits had been conjointly donated to the appellant.  Since it cannot be said that one who makes a donation of lottery ticket is not\nmaking a donation of the prize thereof the appellant begged for the reversal of the\ndecision of the High Court and that the money proceeds of the ticket be given to\nhim in accordance with the donation.",

    "text": "In his reply of Tir 12, 1977 E.C. the respondent said that though the ticket is a movable property\nthe respondent was not the owner of the automobile. Moreover, the appellant did not possess\nthe ticket, nor did he prove the existence of donation pursuant to Article 2447 of the Civil Code. Leaving aside the above, since the ticket commonly belongs to the spouses and according to the\nCivil Code Articles 647 and 658 a spouse cannot make a donation amounting to more than Birr\n100 without the consent of the other spouse, the appellant‟s claim is not acceptable and the\nappeal should accordingly be rejected. Later on, the appellant after reiterating his original grounds asked for the reversal of the decision\nof the High Court in his reply dated 21/6/77. 68\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThe court after the completion of the presentation of the respective arguments by both sides,\nheard the testimony of their witnesses and from the evidence adduced ascertained that the\nrespondent had given the appellant Tombola ticket No. 06068 that won the controversial\nproperty and that the appellant instead of keeping the ticket for himself alone returned it to the\nrespondent with the intention and declaration that he hold it on their behalf. We will examine the points of contention as invoked by both parties here below. Had the appellant accepted the donation and kept the ticket with him, the respondent would not\nhave succeeded if he claimed the ticket back or that he did not donate the prize with the ticket. Similarly, the court could not allow the respondent to be the sole beneficiary of the prize just\nbecause he had the ticket with him. Next we shall see: - (1) Whether or not the ticket and the benefit deriving from it can be viewed\nseparately. (2) If it is proved that the respondent donated the ticket without disclosing the fact\nthat it was a property of someone else could he succeed if he later argued that it was a common\nproperty and therefore could not make the donation alone? As it is gathered from the file that the High Court in its ruling that the plaintiff should be entitled\nto share in the prize won by the ticket based its decision on the nature of the cause of action i.e.\nthe plaintiff‟s claim was not for the ticket but the benefit derivable there from in the future. Moreover, the file indicates that the defendant had given the ticket; this cannot be taken as giving\nalong with it the right, which may arise from it.",

    "text": "The reason stated by the High Court for this was\nthat according to Civil Code Articles 2443 and 2444, in order to validly donate a movable\nproperty delivery should be effected, and that in this case the car which the plaintiff alleges to\nhave been given hasn‟t yet been realized and pursuant to Art. 2451 of the Civil Code, the\ndefendant cannot give property which does not belong to him on the date of the donation; gift\nrelating to future property is of no effect. As far as, we are not in agreement with this ruling for it would be inappropriate to envisage the\nticket and the benefits deriving therefrom separately and because the appellant‟s initial claim was\n69\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nthat he was given a Tombola ticket No. 06068 which has won an automobile worth Birr 100,000\nand that he is entitled to share the proceeds of the ticket with the respondent. As everyone knows, one buys a Tombola ticket or a lottery ticket to be a beneficiary of the right,\nwhich it might entail. If there may be somebody buying such a ticket for purpose otherwise, it\nmay still be deemed that he purchased it to avail himself of the proceeds unless he makes the\npurpose for which he buys the ticket is known. Since what one might get in the form of a prize are clearly specified and listed in the ticket itself,\nit is definite that anyone buying either a lottery or a Tombola ticket does so hoping to win one of\nthe prizes listed. Accordingly it is not debatable that anyone who donates a Tombola or lottery ticket does so with\nthe intention of entitling the donee to the prize for which the ticket number turns out to be a\nwinning one. Thus, we have found the statement that the respondent merely donated the ticket to the appellant\nwithout the changeful benefit it might entail to be unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of\ndonation. A look at Article 2444 of the Civil Code which states bearer titles may be donated by\nmere delivery also covers this present case in which the respondent, as already stated above,\ntransferred the controversial ticket by delivery. What the appellant is in effect demanding is that\nthe ticket be re-delivered to him so that he may draw the proceeds, take his share and give the\nremaining to the respondent. As a result, we resolved that there is no disparity between the law\nand the circumstances of the case under consideration.",

By the same token, we feel that there is no better alternative other than taking\nit for granted that the respondent donated his own ticket. 70\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nAs has already been stated above, since the ticket and the benefit it entails are not separable, in\nno way could it be considered that the respondent donated something out belonging to him. The legal provisions cited viz.

Therefore, since it has been proved that the respondent, with full consent and from his own\npocket gave Tombola ticket No. 06068, bought from the ECA to the appellant and since\nwitnesses have testified and the respondent himself, has by a written memo admitted that it was\nhe who insisted that the appellant accept the donation, and that the respondent however, did not\nestablish that the appellant returned the ticket to him with the intention of renegotiating the full\nbearer title back to him, we have pursuant to Article 348 of the Civil Procedure Code, quashed\nthe decision of the High Court and ruled that “Tombola ticket No. 06068 be common to both the\nappellant and the respondent.

Exercise\nIf the debtor spouse has no personal property, how can the creditor get his money? In other words, a personal debt of one of the spouses may be recovered on the common property\nof the spouses, if the debtor spouse has no personal property or his personal property is not\nsufficient to recover the debt. In such cases, the debtor spouse can go only up to half of the\ncommon property leaving the other half untouched. But some legal scholars do not agree with\nthis concept. They argue that common property of spouses is an undivided unit so long as the\nmarriage is there. Common property shall split only at the time of dissolution of the marriage. Exercise\nCan‟t this concept of “undivided unit” of community of property affect the property\ninterest of one of the spouses, particularly that of the wife?

What is your opinion on the idea of an “undivided unit”? The draft family code prepared by the Ministry of Justice (Art. 74(1)) and the Tigray Family\nCode use similar words to indicate how a personal debt is going to be paid. The words in these\nmaterials could be roughly translated as follows:\n“Debt due by one spouse shall be recovered on the personal property of the indebted spouse.

    "text": "Art.72). This rule should not be taken to mean that each spouse should contribute in\nproportion of his income to the household expenses. The provisions of this Article become\nmeaningless when we think of the situation that only one of them is gainfully occupied. It is\nbelieved that the house-making spouse (usually women in our situation) is contributing equally\nwith the spouse who is the breadwinner of the family. The lawmaker‟s intention in this case is,\neach spouse should try to the best of his ability for the well-being of the household. The whole point here is that, the spouses are jointly responsible for the support of the family. The expenses for such support and other conjugal obligations shall be paid from the common\nproperty such as income and fruits of their common or personal properties. In case of\ninsufficiency or absence of said income or fruits, such obligations shall be satisfied from the\nseparate (or personal) properties.

The legislature\nis very reasonable in introducing such an imposition on those spouses who make such\ncontracts. Because, it is the safest mechanism of protecting rights of third parties. One very important thing that is missing in the RFC is the idea included in Art. 645 of the Civil\nCode of 1960. Art. 645 reads as follows:\nArt. 645. — Occupation of spouses. (1) Each of the spouses may carry on the occupation or the activity of his\nchoice.

If there is no agreement reached between the spouses, the\ncourt may decide on the case. SUMMARY\n All forms of marriage will produce effects just from their conclusion and the law makes\nno distinction between different kinds of marriage as far as producing effects is\nconcerned.  Contract of marriage as is referred in many countries, as a marriage settlement, is not a\nvery common practice in Ethiopia. A contract of marriage is an agreement reached\nbetween the future spouses before they got married. The future spouses shall determine\ntheir personal as well a their pecuniary relations in their contract of marriage. That is,\nthey shall determine prior to the conclusion of the actual marriage they agree as to how\n75\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nthey shall govern their personal and pecuniary relations. Concluding a contract of\nmarriage is not equivalent to celebrating marriage. Contract of marriage is a special\ncontract that needs the deposit of the document in the court or with the office of civil\nstatus. The last date to conclude a contract of marriage is the date of celebration of\nmarriage.  When the spouses govern their marriage by a contract of marriage, it is said that their\nmarriage is governed by a contractual regime. However, in many cases there is no\ncontract of marriage and the provisions of the law regulate such spouses‟ marriages. When the law regulates the personal and pecuniary relations of spouses, it is said that\ntheir marriage is governed by a legal regime.  Personal effects of marriage result from the closer relationship between the spouses. These effects are concerned with the person of the spouses. Personal effects of marriage\ninclude: the obligation to respect, support and assist each other; the living together of the\nspouses under the same roof; the sexual intercourse between the spouses; duty of\nfidelity, etc.  Pecuniary effects of marriage are the property relations that are created in marriage. The\nEthiopian family law allows two types of property relations between spouses. These are\npersonal properties and common properties. Personal property is the one that was owned\nby one of the spouses before the marriage or the property that is acquired in marriage by\nway of donation or succession by one of the spouses. Incomes from personal efforts of\neach of the spouses and incomes generated from common or personal properties are\ncommon properties of the spouses.",

CHPTER 4\nDISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE\nINTRODUCTION\nAs it has already been discussed earlier, marriage is a serious commitment, which creates\nimportant rights and duties for both spouses. Because of the importance of the family unit to the\nsociety, the government has a strong interest in regulating the dissolution of marriage. 77\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThus, just as two people cannot conclude their marriage unless they meet certain requirements in\nthe law, two people cannot dissolve their marriage unless they meet certain legal requirements. A marriage ceases to exist as a result of its dissolution. The causes of dissolution of marriage are\ndeath of one of the spouses or declaration of absence of one of them, dissolution by court order\n(invalidation) or divorce. Divorce is the most frequent means of dissolving marriage. Divorce involves the difficult\nquestion, as to how to liquidate the pecuniary relation between spouses and custody of children. The liquidation of pecuniary relations is also made when marriages are dissolved by the death of\na spouse and court orders. There may be various types of divorce exist, of which the main three types will be treated here\nvery briefly. These are: fault-based divorce, no-fault divorce, and divorce by mutual consent.",

    "text": "Under fault-based divorce, a spouse may only divorce if he or she can prove that the other spouse\nhas committed a fault, which the society recognizes as serious enough to justify ending the\nmarriage. Generally, the faults that the society has decided are serious enough to justify ending a\nmarriage will be listed in the family law. Fault-based divorce is based on the idea that marriage is a lifelong commitment from which a\nperson should not be easily released. Fault-based divorce recognizes, however, that under\ncertain circumstances a spouse should be allowed to quit the marriage relationship. These\ncircumstances generally exist when one spouse has committed a serious breach of his or her\nmarital duties. Traditionally, many countries have used a fault-based system. Obtaining a divorce in a fault-\nbased system is difficult. This is because the spouse who desires the divorce must prove to the\ncourt the existence of one of the faults listed in the law. In some cases this is difficult to do. For\nexample, if the guilty spouse denies committing the fault, and there is no other evidence of the\nfault, the court may not believe the complaining spouse. 78\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nIt should be noted that the general rule in countries adhering to fault-based grounds for divorce is\nthat only the injured spouse may file a complaint for divorce on one of the fault grounds. The\nspouse who is at fault may not use his own fault as a ground for a complaint for divorce. In contrast, under no-fault divorce, a spouse need not prove fault by the other spouse in order to\nterminate the marriage. Thus, under no-fault divorce, one spouse may obtain a divorce simply\nbecause he is no longer happy in the marriage. It is usually much simpler to obtain a divorce\nunder no-fault rules than under a fault-based system, since the party seeking to divorce does not\nhave to prove fault. There are various types of no-fault laws. For example, under some no-fault laws, the spouse who\nwants the divorce must show simply that the marriage is “irretrievably broken” or that there are\n“irreconcilable differences” between the spouses. Under other no-fault laws, divorce is permitted\nif the couple has lived apart for a specified length of time. No-fault divorce is based on more modern notions of personal liberty than fault-based divorce.",

    "text": "One idea behind no-fault divorce is that people should be free to terminate relationships that are\nno longer a source of personal satisfaction. No-fault divorce is also based on the idea that if one\nspouse really desires to divorce, it is not good to force that person to remain in the marriage. Finally, no-fault laws have also developed because some people felt that requiring a spouse to\nprovide evidence of fault made it too difficult to divorce under the fault system. No-fault divorce has become more common in many countries in the past few decades. During\nthat time, some countries have completely eliminated fault-based divorce and adopted no-fault\ndivorce. The rise of no-fault divorce has not been without criticism. Some people have criticized no-fault\ndivorce for making divorce too easy to obtain. These critics argue that no-fault divorce\nencourages a frivolous or silly attitude towards the marriage commitment. Some critics argue\nthat if one spouse faithfully has performed his or her marital duties, it is not fair to allow the\nother spouse to divorce him or her. 79\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nA third general approach to divorce is, divorce by mutual consent. Under this approach, divorce\nis allowed when both parties voluntarily consent to the divorce. Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n List down the causes of dissolution of marriage;\n Propose the mechanisms as to how the pecuniary relations between the spouses are\nliquidated at the time of dissolution of marriage;\n Distinguish between divorce by mutual consent and divorce by petition. In Ethiopia, the RFC has revolutionized the divorce provisions. Under this Code, to get divorce\nis not a difficult process. In the Civil Code too, a spouse always had the right to get divorce. But\nin the Civil Code there were grounds in which the party who required divorce was penalized. In\nthe RFC, there is no penalty imposed on either party as a result of the dissolution of marriage by\ndivorce. In this section you will study how and why duly established marriages are dissolved. All forms of marriage stand on the same foot as far as dissolution of marriage is concerned. This\nmeans, any cause that dissolves, say a civil marriage will also dissolve a religious marriage. This\nis also true for customary marriage. The effects of dissolution of marriage are also similar in all\ncases.",

    "text": "The causes and effects of dissolution of marriage are the same regardless of the form of\nmarriage celebration. According to Article 75 of the RFC the dissolution of marriage will be caused by:\na) Death of one of the spouses, or declaration of absence. 80\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nDeath of either of the spouses or both of them simultaneously shall dissolve a marriage. When\nthe law says “death of one of the spouses” is to indicate that death of only one of the spouses is\nenough to dissolve the marriage. b) Court order to invalidate the marriage. The court orders dissolution of the marriage when the marriage is concluded by violating one of\nthe essential conditions of marriage. Exercise\nWhat are the essential conditions of marriage? To refresh your memory of the essential conditions of marriage, let us take one of the essential\nconditions — age. You know that the minimum marriageable age is 18 years to both men and\nwomen. Therefore, attaining the full age of 18 years is an essential condition to conclude\nmarriage. If a man or a woman marries before he/she attains the full age of 18 years, the court,\nupon application, shall invalidate the marriage, by any interested person or the public prosecutor. Similarly, the court can order the dissolution of marriages that violate any of the essential\nconditions of marriage upon the application of the appropriate persons at the right time. c) Divorce. As a result of disagreement in marriage, spouses may decide (both by their mutual agreement) or\nonly one of them may decide to discontinue the marriage. If marriage is discontinued on such\ndecision, the dissolution of the marriage is said to have been caused by divorce. When the spouses feel that they can no more live together they may agree to dissolve their\nmarriage by their mutual consent. Exercise\n81\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nCan spouses dissolve their marriage (say, by physically destroying their certificate of\nmarriage), without following any additional procedure? Why? Why not? According to the RFC, marriage shall dissolve by divorce in two ways; namely, divorce by\nmutual consent of the spouses where their consent is accepted by the court and divorce by\npetition of both spouses conjointly or by a petition made only by one of the spouses.

    "text": "82\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n4.1 Divorce by Mutual Consent\nDivorce by mutual consent and divorce by petition are discussed in detail in the article entitled,\n“Divorce Under the Ethiopian Legal System: An Overview” which is reproduced below. Divorce by mutual consent was not allowed in the Civil Code. But the Civil Code‟s intention is\nnot to prohibit divorce totally. Its intention seems to prohibit divorce by a simple agreement of\nthe parties without fulfilling the legal requirements. The Amharic version of the Code is clearer\non this point than the English version. In the RFC, parties are allowed to divorce each other by\ntheir agreement. However, still they are required to fulfill the legal requirements. That is, they\ncannot quit their marriage relation by their agreement without following the procedures of\ndivorce that are required by the law. Although the parties are allowed to dissolve their marriage\nby their mutual consent, it is the court that makes the final pronouncement on the divorce. The parties, while they are submitting the document of their agreement, they are expected to\ninclude the regulation of the consequences or conditions of divorce in the document. Exercise\nWhat are the consequences or/conditions of divorce? 4.2 Divorce by Petition\nThis is the second divorce procedure in which both of the parties jointly or either of the two\npresents his petition to the court. The basic difference between divorce by mutual consent and\ndivorce by petition is that, in the former case the parties dissolve their marriage more amicably\nthan the latter one. That is, they dissolve their marriage at their home and they go to the court to\nget its approval. This means the parties simply prepare the draft of their recommendation to\ndissolve their marriage by their mutual agreement. It becomes effective only when the court\napproves it. 83\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThe two divorce procedures have certain differences and similarities. ( For more details see\nbelow)\nAs a result of divorce, the spouses are going to live separately. With which parent should the\ncustody of children be? With the father or with the mother? When the spouses submit their\nmutual consent of divorce to the court, they are also expected to regulate such consequences of\ndivorce. According to sub Article (3) of Article 77 the spouses are not obliged to state their reason for\ndissolving their marriage. The court also cannot force them to express the reasons for divorce.",

    "text": "But this was not the case in the provisions of the Civil Code. In the Civil Code there were\nserious and non-serious (other) grounds for divorce. The consequences of divorce in both cases\n(serious and non-serous causes) were different. However, in the RFC there is no distinction as to\na serious or non-serious cause of divorce. The serious causes of divorce in the Civil Code were generally divided into two. These were;\ncauses that were imputable to one of the spouses and causes that were not imputable to one of the\nspouses. Serious causes that were imputable to one of the spouses were adultery and deserting\nlife in common. There were also serious causes of divorce that were not imputable to one of the\nspouses. These were, when one of the spouses was confined in a lunatic asylum for not less than\ntwo years, or when absence of one of the spouses was judicially declared, or when the religious\nauthorities nullified a religious marriage. Divorce was also validly ordered for non-serious or other causes. Non-serious or other causes\nare causes other than serious causes. Therefore, any reason can serve as a serious cause. The\nonly sanction against the spouse who petitions for divorce in the absence of a serious cause is\nunequal division of the common property in favor of the innocent party.

    "text": "Dissolution of a marriage may not be as easy as we may think. It has so many complications in\nthe case where the marriage dissolves as a result of divorce. The complications were even so\nsevere in the Civil Cod. For instance one of the things that add to the complication in the divorce\nprocedure was, the restitution of presents and matrimonial benefits, which were received by the\nspouses on the occasion of the marriage. Art. 691 of the Civil Code is read as follows:\nArt. 691. — Presents and matrimonial benefits. (1) On the request of the persons who have given presents or of their heirs, the family\narbitrators may order the restitution of such presents as may have been received by the\nspouse on the occasion of the marriage or by reason of the existence of the marriage,\n86\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nwhether by one spouse from the other or from the ascendants of one of the spouses or\nfrom other persons. (2) They may invalidate such other benefits as may have been made or promised to the\nspouses or to one of them, by one of the spouses or by a third person on the occasion or\nin consideration of the marriage. This idea seems to be very logical. Because it protects the interests of those persons who have\ngiven some gifts and donations to the spouses believing that the marriage shall persist longer. However, when the spouses dissolve their marriage through divorce, the ones that have given\ntheir property by expecting the persistence of the marriage may be disappointed with the\ndissolution of the marriage. That is why the Civil Code gave them the right to request the\nrestitution of the property they had given by way of gift or donation on the occasion of the\nmarriage. It seems that the RFC is much more concerned with the time that is wasted to\naccommodate all these procedures and litigations. Cases\n1. Wro. Engidazer Nega vs. Ato Worota Alemayehu, Civil Appeal File No 1174/73\nIn this case, the family arbitrators proposed that the wife has left life in common and lived for\nfive years outside marriage. Moreover, she confirmed that she needed no partition of the\ncommon property and she waived her status of being wife of Ato Worota. Hence according to\nthe decision of the family arbitrators, the marriage was dissolved by this behavior of the wife. Wro.

That is, courts\nshow some degree of inclination to accept the dissolution of marriage by divorce even if the\n88\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nprocedural requirements of divorce are not fulfilled. This case supplies additional strength to\nthis argument. In this case, the husband was accused of a crime of bigamy and sentenced a six\nmonths imprisonment by the Federal First Instance Court. Upon appeal to the Federal High\nCourt, the man was acquitted of the crime of bigamy. Because, the Federal High Court\nconsidered the former marriage was dissolved, although the divorce was conducted in front of\nthe elderly people without being approved by the court, that is, without a court homologation. In larger parts of this country the parties end their marriage through customary ways. Various\nreasons could be forwarded to such divorce proceedings. Firstly, most people live away from\ncourts and they are unaware of even the need to take their divorce cases to the attention of the\ncourt. Secondly, many people do not like the publicity of their family affairs and avoid court\nproceedings for divorce purposes. The prevalence of the situation would seem to suggest the\nlegal recognition of an extra-judicial divorce. Read the following article on divorce carefully. DIVORCE UNDER THE ETHIOPIAN LEGAL SYSTEM:  AN\nOVERVIEW\nBy: Mellese Damtie\nI. \nINTRODUCTION\nDivorce is the legal separation of man and wife, effected by the judgment or decree of a court,\nand either totally dissolving the marriage relation, or suspending its effects so far as concerns the\ncohabitation of the parties.1\nThis definition reveals the following important points.  Divorce is pronounced by a court of law,\n BSc, LLB, LLM, Lecturer at the Ethiopian Civil Service College. 1 Henry Campbell Black, Black‟s law Dictionary (6th ed), west publishing Co., 1990\n89\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n Divorce is of two types. One type totally and absolutely dissolves the marriage (Divorce a vinculo matrimonii). The other\ntype simply orders the legal separation of the husband and wife without totally breaking the\nmatrimonial relation of the spouses (Divorce a mensa et thoro). The latter is commonly referred\nto as “separation from bed and board.”",

    "text": "The idea of separation from bed and board was developed from the conception that “marriage is\nindissoluble in any way other than death”. This was predominantly the Catholic precept of\nmarriage. In this arrangement, a party to a marriage was absolved from his duty to live with the\nother without being freed, however, from the tie of the marriage. That is, each spouse is\nprevented from a remarriage during the lifetime of the other spouse.2  The decree of separation\nwould be granted only when a party to a marriage had been guilty of a serious breach of marital\nduty, such as adultery on the wife‟s part, or extreme cruelty or abandonment on that of the\nhusband.3\nStrict divorce laws were a later development in the history of divorce. For instance, the classical\ndivorce law of Rome was extremely liberal. A marriage could be dissolved by the mutual\nagreement of the spouses or at the will of either party.4  Even there was no requirement by the\nspouses to give the reasons, which led them to separate. Nor did the law determine the grounds\nof the rupture.5  It was as a result of religious intervention that marriage became an indissoluble\ninstitution and consequently divorce was avoided. However, to create absolutely permanent and indissoluble marriage was not as such successful,\nsince annulment and separation had to be permitted for various reasons. The impossibility of\nforcing people to live together in the intimacy marriage compelled the Church to authorize\nseparation from bed and board.6  This separation is commonly known as a judicial separation.

Instead, grounds\nfor judicial separation were increased.",

But the attempt failed.10    Surprisingly enough, however, in less\nthan a decade later the Divorce Reform Act of 1969 allowed divorce if the parties had lived apart\nfor two years (and both consented) or five years (if one did not consent).11\nIn France, keeping with the Catholic character of the state, marriage was treated as indissoluble\nall through the ancien regime. But the 1789 Revolution brought the extremely liberal divorce\nlaw of 1792, which even provided the possibility of the dissolution of a marriage upon the\nmutual agreement of the parties.12   Through Napoleon‟s Civil Code of 1804 divorce was made\nmore difficult, and under the Bourbon restoration, the wheel was turned back fully and divorce\nwas completely abolished in 1816, not to be reintroduced again until the Third Republic‟s liberal\nlaw of 1884.13   A practice of continuously increasing liberalism was again reversed by the\nlegislation of Marshal Petain‟s Vichy government, but this, in turn, was repealed upon the\nliberation of France in 1945.14\n7 Cited above, at note 2, p. 4. 8 David M.

The law takes as\none of the “divorce hindrance devices” the imposition of penalty. 49\nThe system of fault divorce is the one in which one of the parties proves a fault committed by the\nother party; the fault that is recognized by law as a ground to demand divorce. In this system,\ndivorce is a privilege granted to an innocent spouse.50   That is, unless one of the parties proves a\nfault recognized as a ground for divorce, no divorce would be granted. This situation is totally\ninexistent in the Ethiopian setting and a party is not required to prove the fault of the other party\nfor the purpose of getting a divorce pronouncement.

It means, “divorce by mutual consent between spouses is not allowed unless it\nis made in accordance with the law”. ( Translation mine)  This is quite different from the English\nversion that states, “Divorce by mutual consent is not permitted by law.” According to the\nEnglish version, divorce by mutual consent is prohibited. But this is not the case with the\nAmharic version, which is the controlling version. The Amharic version allows divorce by\nmutual consent if it is made by fulfilling the legal requirements for divorce. For instance, the\nspouses cannot end their marriage by simply tearing their certificate of marriage to pieces and go\naway from each other. Instead they are required to observe the divorce procedures prescribed by\nthe law after mutually deciding on the issue of divorce. 48 Ibid., Art. 694. 49 See John H.

The door for such divorces is not closed under the\n1960 Civil Code. Problems of putting a party at fault\nAs we have noted above, proving the guilt of the other party serves two important purposes. i) \nThe party at fault shall be penalized by losing some property in favor of the innocent\nparty. ii) \nThe divorce pronouncement shall be ordered within relatively shorter period. However, when divorce is ordered in the absence of a serious cause, the innocent party cannot\nrequire the divorce procedure be shorter.

    "text": "According to the Black‟s Law Dictionary, adultery is a “Voluntary sexual intercourse of a\nmarried person with a person other than the offender’s husband or wife…” 53 This definition\nrequires the actual act of sexual union (penetration of a female by a male), that puts the proof in a\nprofound difficulty. The plaintiff (usually the wife) claims that her husband has committed\nadultery. In most cases the defendant denies that he has committed adultery. The nature of the\noffence compels those who involve in adultery to perform it in a clandestine manner. We are not\ncertain that the court would presume adultery on the ground of certain circumstantial evidence. Can one be sure that the court would presume adultery, if opposite sexes are seen coming out of\na hotel room or any other similar place? In one case,54 the High Court did not accept the\nhusband‟s allegation that the wife committed adultery by living with a certain Mehret Desalegn,\nsleeping in the same bed. Because the woman responded that the man was her aunt‟s grandson\nand she denied that she had committed such incestuous sexual relation. But upon appeal to the\nSupreme Court, the appellate court presumed adultery on the ground that the woman failed to\ncall the father‟s name of the man with whom she lived for a long time and on the fact that the\n“relative” of the woman and her husband did not know each other. “Based on the allegation of a spouse (usually a wife), it is not possible to \npresume adultery. Most women who have the courage to reveal the acts of their \nhusbands simply claim that they have discovered prints of lipstick or strands of \nhair on the clothes of their husbands. Some others allege that they caught red \nhanded their husbands while kissing their maidservants, etc. Some or even \nmost of these allegations may be true.

The High\nCourt also affirmed the decision of the family arbitrators. It reasoned that the appellant did not\nproduce any evidence that puts her husband at fault and hence she was imputable to the\ndissolution of the marriage. In Ethiopia the society does not strongly disprove marital offences committed by men (such as\nadultery and domestic violence). The law requires a wife, irrespective of these situations, to\nprove her husband‟s adultery. The consequence of failure to prove her husband‟s adultery is a\npecuniary penalty, since she has nothing as a serious cause on her behalf. This system has\nopened the door for husbands who are inspired by malice, to unduly benefit at the expense of\ntheir wives‟ economic interest, using the arms of the law. b) Problem associated with revealing the fact of adultery when it is\ncommitted between relatives:\nSometimes it occurs that a spouse may commit adultery with brother or sister of the other\nspouse, or even with the child of the other spouse (usually with a step-daughter). In such\ncircumstances, spouses may get it shameful and indecent to reveal such facts, although they may\nhave sufficient evidence. Because they may feel that the publicity of such facts may injure the\nreputation of the family. As one judge says,\n“…Let alone such kind of sexual intercourse between relatives, parties are \ndisinterested to reveal the committing of adultery of the other spouse with an \noutsider.

It appears from this that women are placed in double jeopardy by this system of\ndivorce. c) Incrimination\nPutting a party in a fault means incriminating that party against the alleged offence. Incrimination does not necessarily serve the intended purposes. It would lead the parties into a\nfierce and protracted litigation, which would in turn enhance enmity between the parties by\nblocking the possibilities of friendly divorce proceedings. The incrimination may not also be on\ngenuine grounds and it could be a mere perjury. Moreover, the defendant may resort to a furious\nrecrimination, adding fuel on already burning fire. d) Distinction between the poor and the rich\nProving fault can be applied for those who are better off economically. For those who have little\nor no property, it is meaningless to put the other party at fault. Whether the other party is at fault\nor not is pointless so long as there is no property to partition. Because only those who have\ncommon property shall continue in the litigation, by trying to get any sorts of evidence in their\nfavor. Those who have no common property have no reason to prove the fault of the other\nspouse. III. THE TIGRAY FAMILY CODE\n101\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThe Tigray Family Code of November 1998 has introduced a landmark change in the divorce\nproceeding of the spouses. That is, it abolished the penalty of the spouse who is imputable to the\ndissolution of marriage by divorce. Moreover, it explicitly stated that divorce is a right.58\nAccording to Art. 102 of this Code, when one or both of the spouses claim that they can no more\nlive together in their marriage, their right to get divorced is respected. (Translation mine)  This\nidea finds its root in the FDRE Constitution, which prescribes that, “Marriage shall be entered\ninto only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. ”59\nThis constitutional rule has to be interpreted to mean that consent is required not only at the\nconclusion of the marriage but also during the whole lifetime of the marriage. The Tigray\nFamily Code allowed the parties to divorce without the need to put one of them in fault and\nhence without the need to penalize him. It seems that the Code is of the opinion that, to exercise\none‟s constitutional right, one should not be penalized.",

    "text": "At the same time, the Code liberalized\ndivorce proceedings owing to the easy divorce practice of the society. In practice, Tigrayan\nmarriage is a civil contract and may be dissolved at the request of either partner.60  As we have\nnoted above, this situation holds true for other parts of the country too. The Code also provides for the compulsory counseling of the parties by the social courts so that\nthe parties are advised to reconcile and renounce their intention to divorce.61  This step is\nconsidered; it seems, as a “divorce hindrance device.” As a concluding remark, it could be said that the Tigray Family Code has paved the way in\nexpressly prescribing that divorce is the right of spouses when they feel that they cannot live\ntogether and in avoiding the proof of fault by one spouse to penalize the other.

Because, as we have seen above, both types\nof divorce proceedings were prescribed by the Civil Code, especially by the Amharic Version. The only difference one can note here is that, regarding divorce by mutual consent it is\nprescribed in a negative or prohibitive way in the Civil Code but the approach of the Revised\nFamily Code is a permissive or a positive one. According to the rules of divorce by mutual consent, divorce is allowed when both parties\nvoluntarily consent to the divorce. Accordingly, the parties are expected to appear before the\ncourt after deciding that their marriage is dissolved by their common agreement.",

Of course the spouses can agree to\nlive separately for definite or indefinite period of time81. This is an exception to Art 53(1) of the\nRFC. According to this provision, the marriage shall not be affected by the mere fact that the\nspouses lived separately. But, does this assumption work when the spouses live separately\nwithout any prior agreement and with the intention not live together in the future? Exceptional\nprovisions should be interpreted restrictively and when spouses leave each other with such an\nintention, it would be inappropriate to consider that the marriage has not been affected. It is true that there are three causes of dissolution of marriage namely:  death of one of the\nspouses, or declaration of absence of one of the spouses; dissolution by court order; or divorce.82\nAs it has been discussed hitherto, divorce can take place only by fulfilling the legal requirements. 79 Ibid., Art. 49 \n80 Ibid., Art. 53(1). 81 Ibid., Art.55(1) \n82 Ibid., Art. 75. 107\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nAny act short of this cannot bring a marriage to an end.

After the occurrence of all these\ncircumstances, if A petitions for the divorce of his marriage with B, can he claim division of the\npriority obtained by B? In one case,83 the man deserted his wife, mother of his seven children and stayed away for about\nfifteen years. During this time he fathered eight children from different women, while his\ndeserted wife was taking care of the seven children alone. The man, with the intent of\npartitioning their common house and other properties that were the result of efforts of the woman\nduring his desertion, petitioned for divorce.",

Strict divorce laws were mainly the result of the conception of indissolubility of marriage. The\nRoman Catholic Church played a great role for the dissemination of the idea of indissolubility of\nmarriage. The world was not successful in having indissoluble marriages. Partial or qualified\ndivorce known as separation from bed and board was introduced for the spouses who could not\nlive together. Into this system of divorce, the matrimonial obligations of the parties are intact\nsave that they are allowed to live separately. For instance, the spouses are not allowed to\nremarry. This is not the culmination in the evolution of divorce law. Later divorce in its full sense was\nallowed on the ground of fault by one of the spouses. Adultery and disserting life in common by\none spouse were most commonly accepted grounds of divorce. In many jurisdictions the\ngrounds have been increased from time to time. For instance in the United States of America,102\ndivorce was allowed on the ground that the wife frequently visited her mother, considering her\nfrequent visit as a cruel act against her husband. Increasing fault grounds was also considered\nunbearable since there is no point to stop.",

    "text": "Finally, the world has moved to a no-fault divorce in\nwhich divorce could be granted without the need to prove the fault of the other party. Divorce\nby mutual consent of spouses has also been enacted in many countries. In Ethiopia divorce is not a thing that is disquieting the society. It was a commonplace practice\nsince longtime ago and most marriages dissolve through divorce than death. There is an\nestablished custom of handling family affairs through customary arbitration. The arbitrators,\nusually the elderly people, play a great role in resolving disputes between the spouses. They also\ninvolve in passing divorce decisions, even after the advent of the Civil Code. The 1960 Civil Code came up with serious and non-serious causes of divorce. The serious\ncauses are also divided into two; causes to which the party is imputable and those to which the\nparty is not imputable. Adultery and deserting the conjugal residence are grouped under the\nformer category. Declaration of absence, being an inmate of a lunatic asylum for a minimum of\ntwo years and condemnation of the marriage by religious authorities are grouped under the latter\n102 http://company.findlaw.com/jobs/index.html, visited on May 8, 2002. 115\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\ncategory. Divorce can also validly be ordered for non-serious causes. In such cases, the party\nwho has petitioned for divorce is said to be imputable to the dissolution of marriage. The whole purpose of considering one party as imputable to the dissolution of marriage is\npenalizing the guilty party property-wise in favor of the innocent party. But as it has been\nexperimented for more than forty years, making one party imputable to the dissolution is not an\neasy task. Especially when one party alleges that the other has committed adultery, such party\ncannot succeed due to lack of cogent evidence that proves the alleged offence. Women remained\nvictims of this system of divorce owing to their economic and social positions. The Revised Family Code of 2000 has abolished proving fault of the other spouse for the\npurpose of penalizing him. According to this Code, no penalty is imposed against the party who\nis requiring divorce. This new rule is based on, it seems, on the conception that divorce is a right\nand nobody should be penalized because he has exercised his right. This new law is expected to reduce protracted litigations between parties to make one of the\nparties imputable to the dissolution of the marriage.",

    "text": "As the result of this new development in the\ndivorce law, divorce can be easily granted. Although this is a positive step in resolving problems\nassociated with divorce litigations, care must be taken that it should not create another set of\nproblems. It goes without saying that majority of women in Ethiopia are economically dependent on men\nand marriage is considered for many as an employment opportunity. Having regard to this and\nsocial background of women, it would be unwise to leave them without any post-divorce\nobligation on the side of their husbands. 116\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThe following are suggested as recommendations.  Liberalizing stricter divorce provisions is a timely and modern action. Its\nimportance in reducing endless disputes and court litigations between parties is\nimmense. Moreover, it relieved women from the difficulty of proving fault,\nespecially adultery to get their husbands punished. Easy divorce procedures may\nbe disadvantageous to women, especially when the marriage is dissolved during\nthe old age of women. Family law should introduce a post-divorce maintenance to\na party who cannot earn his livelihood by his work. Consequently, the Pension\nProclamation should be revised to allow a divorced spouse to have right over the\npension allowance of his spouse.  Our society commonly conducts divorce outside courtrooms, although the law\nempowers only the court to pronounce divorce. Sometimes even courts consider\nas though the marriage was dissolved through customary ways even if the court\ndid not approve the customary divorce. Owing to the prevalence of this practice,\nthe law should recognize divorces that have taken place through customary ways,\nwithout affecting the mandatory provisions of the law.  Sometimes marriages become dead per se. This usually happens when the parties\nlive separately for long time with the intention of not to live together again. Having regard to the conditions of the parties, the law must devise a mechanism\nto declare such marriages as non-existent.  During divorce procedures, the law must make counseling parties by the court as\na mandatory procedure rather than leaving it to the discretion to the courts\nSUMMARY\n117\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n All forms of marriages are dissolved in similar manners. The cause that dissolves one\nform of marriage also dissolves another form of marriage. Of the causes that dissolve a\nmarriage the most important one as far as legal issues are concerned is divorce.  The Revised Family Code has brought a big change on divorce provisions of the Civil\nCode.",

    "text": "In the Civil Code, the causes of divorce are divided into two. These are, serious\ncauses and other causes. When a spouse proves on his favor the existence of a serious\ncause of divorce he shall escape penalty. For instance, if one spouse commits adultery,\nthe other spouse can get the declaration of divorce without being penalized. It is the one\nwho has committed adultery that is going to be penalized. In the Revised Family Code,\nthere is no penalty at all. Moreover, the Revised Family Code allowed divorce by mutual\nconsent.  There are two procedures of divorce in the Revised Family Code. These are, divorce by\nmutual consent and divorce by petition. In the former case, the spouses who have decided\nnot to live together shall agree to conclude their marriage by divorce. Then they appear\nbefore the court to demand the court to approve their mutual agreement of divorce. In the\nlatter case, both spouses together or one of them alone petitions to the court that the court\nwould pronounce divorce. Except the existence of slight procedural differences between\nthe two kinds of divorce, there are no fundamental differences between the two kinds of\ndivorce. 118\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nCHAPTER 5\nLIQUIDATION OF PECUNIARY RELATIONS\nBETWEEN SPOUSES\nINTRODUCTION\nWhen marriage is dissolved by any cause (that is, as a result of death of one or both spouses,\ndeclaration of absence, court order or divorce) the pecuniary relations between the spouses shall\nalso be liquidated. This is to mean that: if spouses are debtors they have to pay back what they\nowe to their creditors, or if they are creditors, they must collect their money from their debtors,\nand also divide their common property between themselves. Property division is one of the most\ndifficult aspects of divorce, because usually the spouses disagree over who has the right to the\nproperty. In the past, many countries have discriminated against women by giving them fewer property\nrights than men, both during marriage and divorce. Throughout the world, the laws of many\ncountries have failed to recognize the important role that women play in the family economy. The RFC provides that in case of divorce property of spouses shall be divided in accordance with\nagreement of the parties. If the parties fail to agree, division shall be made by the operation of\nthe law. In some cases where there seems to be an “agreement”, that agreement may not really\nbe voluntary.",

But they may agree that only\none of them could administer the common property. Also the owner spouse administers his own\npersonal property. However, the other spouse can be authorized to administer the personal\nproperty of his spouse. The spouse who is vested with the power of administering the common\nproperty or the personal property of the other spouse may be condemned to pay compensation to\nthe other spouse. This could happen if the spouse has performed acts of bad administration, or if\nhis administration constituted bad faith to the prejudice of the other spouse. When one spouse\ndoes such acts, the court may award damages or compensation to the aggrieved spouse, if the\nlatter requests payment of damages. ( Art. 87(1))\nExercise\nHow do you understand a bad administration? A bad administration can be explained in many ways. The following example may illustrate a\nbad administration. Suppose “B” entrusts the administration of her personal property (that she\nacquired by way of succession) to “A”. Let the property is a grand villa, which is to be rented. If “A” does not make any effort to receive the monthly payment and he shows no any activity to\nstop the person who rented the house while he leaves without paying the arrears, “A‟s”\nadministration of the rental house is a bad one.

    "text": "In the above example, “B” loses her right of\nclaiming indemnity payment if five years have elapsed between the act that caused the damage\nand the dissolution of the marriage. As a result of dissolution marriage, creditors of the spouses should not lose their claims. The law\ntries to protect the interest of such creditors. Accordingly, the spouses are ordered to pay back\nthe debt that one of them or both incurred before partition of property. (Art. 89)  Creditors\nwould benefit from this rule. Because it would be easy for them to get their money paid back\nbefore the spouses partition property and depart each other. Once spouses depart each other after\npartition of property, the creditors may be required to divide their claims. 124\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n5.2.3 Partition of Common Property\nAs a rule, common property of spouses is divided equally between the spouses. However, this is\nnot always true. For instance, if one of the spouses is ordered by the court to pay indemnity, and\nsuch spouse does not have sufficient personal property, the indemnity can be paid from the\ncommon property. In such a case, there shall not be an equal division of a common property\nbetween the spouses. Community of property is based on the idea that marriage is a partnership to which both husband\nand wife equally contribute. Thus, on divorce, the wife is entitled to a share of the common\nproperty equal to that of the husband. In many countries this is the rule today. In the past,\nhowever, in a number of countries women received lesser amount of the common property upon\ndivorce. For example, in Cambodia women were taking only one-third of the common property\nwhile men were receiving two-thirds of it. Identifying the common property is a very important work before the common property could be\nready for the purpose of division. The first step in the division is to identify the items of property\nto be divided. In most cases identification of the property may be simple. Most people have\ntheir household belongings. They may own a bicycle and a motorbike. The family may have a\nlittle money or own a home. These are things that will need to be divided between the spouses\non divorce. In other cases, identifying the property to be divided is more difficult. Sometimes it is even\ndifficult to define “property.”",

    "text": "The identification of property may be different in different\ncountries. In addition, the definition may change over time. For instance, in a country that does\nnot allow the ownership of land by private individuals, there may be little problem of how to\ndivide land in case of divorce. Later, if that country allows people to own land and a couple does\nin fact own some land, that becomes a piece of property that must be divided during divorce. Other examples arise as the economy of a country becomes more complicated. New kinds of\neconomic rights may become “property.” For instance, in an increasing number of countries, if a\n125\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nperson works in the military, the government may agree to pay a good deal of money in a lump\nsum or a monthly payment for the life time of the person in reward for his military services. This\npayment is considered as a “property” in many countries, including the United States. Hence at\nthe time of divorce, the right to receive the monthly payment is divided between the spouses. As\nideas of property change, the identification of property for purposes of divorce also changes. Exercise\nIn Ethiopia, can the spouses divide the pension of one of the spouses upon divorce? The second step in the process of property division is to classify each item of property. Each\nitem of property must be classified as either common or personal property. It has been pointed\nout that classifying property as common or personal property during marriage is difficult. During the marriage these problems do not matter so much. At the time of divorce, however, the\nclassification of property as common or personal property will affect how much each spouse will\nreceive as a property settlement. Therefore, classification of the property is very important. In order to classify the property, we must recall the definitions of personal and common\nproperty. Remember that personal property is (1) any property which a spouse possesses prior to\nthe marriage, and (2) any property which a spouse receives as a gift, an inheritance, or a legacy\nduring the marriage. Common property is any property a married couple acquires after the date\nof their marriage, except property either spouse received as a gift, inheritance, or legacy. Common property includes money which either spouse earned during marriage. It also includes\nanything either spouse bought with money earned during the marriage.",

    "text": "Further, it includes\nmoney or property earned during the marriage which has not yet been paid to or received by the\ncouple. A husband and wife together own all their joint property. This is true even if only one spouse\nearned the money to buy the property. Thus, for example, assume that only the husband has\nearned money during the marriage. With his wages, the husband buys a motorbike. Under the\nRFC, both husband and wife own one-half of the motorbike, even though it was purchased with\nthe husband‟s wages and in his name. 126\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nThe biggest problems in classifying property as common or personal property arise when the\nspouses have joined their resources together. For instance, consider the following example:\nExample\nBefore marriage, the husband owned a broken down house that was not worth much. During the marriage he and his wife worked very hard and used a lot of their wages for\nfive years to fix the house up and together made it a valuable house. Is the house still\npersonal property or has it become common property? Upon divorce, a court might consider the original value of the property before it was fixed to be\nthe husband‟s separate property, and the value which the spouses added by their joint effort to be\njoint property. In applying this rule the court would set apart to the husband the value in the\nhouse which is his separate property and then divide between the two spouses the value in the\nhouse which is their joint property. In many countries a piece of property has common and separate contributions to it (like the old\nhouse in disrepair in the above example that both husband and wife worked hard to fix it up). It\nis important to separate out the portion that is personal to one of the spouses and the portion that\nis common to both to determine the economic value of each portion. The Ethiopian Family Law is not very specific. It does not contain clear rules for deciding cases\nlike the above example. Different judges would probably decide these cases in different ways. The third step in the process of dividing property is to value each item. “Valuing” each item,\nmeans determining its economic value. We need to know what the property is worth\neconomically. If you do not value the property, it is not possible to divide it equally.",

    "text": "For\nexample, if the family has two oxen and two chickens, it would not be fair to give one party the\ntwo chickens. The two oxen are much more valuable than the two chickens. 127\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nEconomic value is calculated in different ways depending upon the type of property which we\nneed to value. Economic value is not the same as social value or moral value or sentimental\nvalue. Economic value is the amount of money or value you would receive if you were to sell\nthe piece of property in the marketplace. Art. 90 of the RFC states that common property shall be divided equally, except in certain\ncircumstances. Dividing the property does not require that each person get half of each item. Dividing the property equally requires that each get half of the total value of the property. For\ninstance, you would not cut an ox or a bicycle in half. There could be many instances that justify unequal division of the common property of spouses. The interests of children may justify giving the parent with whom the children are living more\nthan half of the property. For example, if the children remain with one spouse, that person may\nneed the home the parties have been living in. It will probably be difficult for the children if they\nhave to move from their home. The employment situation of the spouses may also justify giving one party more than half of the\ncommon property. For example, if a wife has been raising the children and working in the home\nfor many years, while the man has been working for wages, it may be very hard for that woman\nto go and find a job that will pay her enough money to support herself and the children. It may\nbe fair for her to receive more of the property. However, these situations are not covered by the\nRFC. The provisions of Art 91 deal with rule of partition in kind. According to the rule of partition in\nkind the spouses receive their portion from the common property in the form of goods or\nproducts, not in the form of money. For instance, if they have a house, a car and household\nfurniture, as common property they are expected to divide these properties as they are, rather\nthan selling and dividing the money. For instance, they can agree to give the house to the wife\nand the car and the furniture to the husband. In practice, however, this might sometimes be\nproblematic.",

To balance their shares the wife has\nto pay Birr 20,000 to the husband so that each shall receive the value of Birr 80,000.

The RFC does not specifically address the allocation of debts at divorce. Nevertheless, there\nmust be some decision made regarding who will pay the debts that exist at the time of divorce. Just as property division can be done either by the agreement of the parties or by a judgment of\nthe court, the division of debts can be made by agreement of the parties or by judgment of the\ncourt. The steps for the responsibility for payment of debts of the parties after the divorce are very\nsimilar to the steps in dividing and distributing the property of the parties. The steps are: (1)\nidentification of the debt; (2) classification of the debt as a common or personal obligation; and\n(3) allocation of the responsibility for payment of the debt.

    "text": "In either case,\nboth spouses have a joint responsibility to pay the debt. It is not clear how a court will determine\nwhether one spouse has “consented” to a debt incurred by the other spouse. Moreover, a debt\ncould be considered as a common debt when it is concluded by one spouse and incurred in the\ninterest of the household. A difficult situation arises in some cases when the parties have separated and then wait for many\nmonths or years to divorce. One spouse may incur a debt while the other spouse is not around. 131\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\nIn that case the spouse that was not there while the debt was incurred may deny that the debt was\na common obligation. Such debt could be considered as a common debt if it was made for\nfamily purpose such as caring for the children or repairing the home, but would be a personal\ndebt if the money had been used for the spouse‟s personal affairs. After the debts have been identified as common or personal, the court (or the parties by their\nagreement) must decide who will be responsible for payment of the debts. In the same way that\nis entitled to receive his personal property, it seems likely that each spouse will be obligated to\npay his personal debt. It is also likely that the couple will have to split equally any joint debts. Property division is one of the most important aspects of divorce. Its impact on the future lives\nof the parties, and most especially of their children, is profound. The issues of identification,\nclassification, valuation, and finally, division, that at first glance appear merely technical, in fact\nare central to a fair resolution of all of the issues surrounding the break-up of a marriage. The\npropriety of spousal support, child support, and even child custody, all depend to some degree on\nthe economic circumstances of the parties after the property has been divided. As to the\nchildren, it is not an exaggeration to say that their life circumstances will be determined by the\nprovision made for their economic wellbeing at the time of the judgment of divorce. This is a\nmoment for the judges and lawyers to exercise all the wisdom and foresight of which they are\ncapable. Divorce legally terminates marriage. The termination of the marriage generally terminates the\nduties, which the spouses owed to one another as husband and wife.",

The responsibilities include the responsibility to feed, clothe, shelter,\nand the responsibility to provide for their education. The legal issue referred to as “child\ncustody” is a shorthand term for the process of allocating these rights and responsibilities\nbetween the parents at the time of divorce. The term “child custody” is used in the family law statutes of many countries, but it is rarely\ndefined. The RFC does not use the term itself, although the concept of child custody is included\nin the Code. Some countries tend to divide the general concept of child custody into four sub-\ntopics: (1) legal custody; (2) physical custody; (3) sole custody; and (4) joint or shared custody. The term “legal custody” refers to the legal right to make major decisions about the health,\neducation, and general welfare of a minor child. These decisions include many matters. Some\nof them are:\n The right to decide where the child will go to school;\n The right to decide what religious training the child will have;\n The right to decide whether the child may take a job;\n The right to decide who will care for the child during the day if the custodial\nparent must go to work.",

SUMMARY\n134\nPrepared by: Mellese D.\n The Ethiopian family law does not prohibit agreement between the spouses as far as\nliquidation of their pecuniary relation is concerned. If the marriage was dissolved by their\nmutual consent, the spouses could prepare the liquidation of their pecuniary relations\ntogether with the proposal of divorce. In the absence of such preparations, they have the\nchance of making an agreement how they are going to liquidate their pecuniary relations. It is also possible to determine beforehand by the contract of marriage how they are going\nliquidate their pecuniary relations.  Sometimes, the spouses may be unable to agree on the liquidation of the pecuniary\nrelations. In such circumstances, the provisions of the law shall be applied to liquidate\ntheir pecuniary relations. When the provisions of the law are applied:\nEach spouse shall retake his personal property in kind by showing that he is the\nsole owner of such property;\nEach spouse shall withdraw his personal property that is included in the common\nproperty;\nWhere one spouse has acted to the prejudice of the property interest of the other\nspouse, he may be ordered by the court to pay compensation to the prejudiced\nspouse;\nWhere there are creditors, their interests have to be protected and such creditors\nmust get what they demand from the spouses before the partition of their common\nproperties is made. The law favors partition of common properties in kind, where such course is\npossible. Moreover the law favors the taking of a property that is most useful to a\nspouse. When dividing properties in kind is not possible, they shall be sold by auction and\nthe money will be divided. 135\nPrepared by: Mellese D.",

These disciplines give attention to the institution of family as the\nstrength of a society to the largest extent hinges upon the   strength of the family it has. It\nis because of this that we need to give recognition and protection to this unit of society by\nlaw. As a result, every country in the world has enacted laws which have recognized and\nprotected the institution of family. In addition to domestic laws, there are international\nhuman right conventions which have accorded protection to the institution of family. Ethiopia, being part of the international community, has put in place laws which have\nrecognized and protected family. This course is, therefore, meant to expose students\ntaking the course to the basic principles of family law incorporated under the Ethiopian\nlegal system (the FDRE Constitution, Regional Constitutions, the Revised Family Code\nof the FDRE and other regional family laws).",

Chapter One: General Consideration\nIntroduction\nFamily is the basic unit of a society. It has social as well as economic importance in any\nsociety. Naturally, persons bound by consanguinity and affinity are united to form the\ncommunity. ‘ With time, the growing family has a tendency to become a tribe. ’1\nThe\nformation of a tribe entails the splitting up or disintegration of the family, so as to make a\nnew and additional family in the society. With the increase in the number of families\narise various issues; like responsibilities and rights of the family members. The need to\nhave a law governing the family relationship is somehow tied with the development of\nfamily through time. Considering this need, societies have developed one branch of law\nsolely dealing with issues related to the family: Family Law. Family Law is the branch of law which sets the rules to govern the ongoing\nresponsibilities of family members to each other; both at the time families are formed and\nafter relationships dissolve. The application of the family law begins at the time of\nformation of family either through marriage or irregular union.",

In this chapter, you will learn about the sources of family law, the reasons for protecting\nand regulating the family, the sources as well as effects of family relationships. Objectives\nAt the end of this chapter, students will be able to:\n discuss the meaning and sources of family law.  analyze the rationale behind protection and regulation of family.  understand the different sources of family relationship.  discuss the effects of family relationship. 1 Planiol, 385\n1.1 Definition and Sources of Family Law\nThere is no generally accepted definition of family law. ‘ Family law is usually seen as the\nlaw governing the relationship between children and parents, and between adults in close\nemotional relationships’2\n. Many areas of law can have an impact on family life: tax laws,\nimmigration laws as well as insurance laws have great connection with family law. As\nDewar noted:\nMost legal disciplines would claim to possess at least one of two forms of\ncoherence. The first stems from the organizing legal concept from which the\ndiscipline in question derives its name: ‘contract’, ‘negligence’, ‘trust’. The\nsecond relates to the set of ‘real world’ problems with which the discipline is\nconcerned: labor relations, housing, land use, commerce, government and\nadministration. At first glance, it would seem that the area of study\ndesignated as family law possesses a coherence of the second sort. After all,\nthe term ‘family’ has in itself no legal significance (although attempts are\noften made to define the family for legal purposes); and the subject usually\ncomprises a mixed bag of legal rules and concepts, such as those concerned\nwith marriage, divorce, parents and children and property, each possessing a\ndifferent historical origin and pattern of development. The only justification\nfor studying them together is that they all in some way concern the family, a\nsocial phenomenon constituted outside the categories of the law. For this\nreason, family law has grown over the years to include parts of other legal\ndisciplines of relevance to the family, such as property, criminal and housing\nlaw, taxation, social security, evidence and procedure; as well as\nincorporating legal aspects of phenomena thought to have a ‘family’\nconnection, such as domestic violence, child abuse, marital rape, surrogacy,\nhomelessness and pensions (to name a few).",

    "text": "In spite of this, can it still be said that family law is a coherent area of study? It has already been suggested that it cannot satisfy the first criterion of\ncoherence mentioned above; and if it were to satisfy the second, the subject\nwould be a good deal broader than it is now, probably unmanageable so. For\n2 Jonathan Herring, 9\nif we were really to take the family as the starting point, and were to consider\nall areas of law relevant to the family, we would want to include much that is\nnot currently considered part of the subject. For example, we might wish to\nconsider the welfare state, the fiscal system and the labor market in more\ndetail than is customary; and we may also want to consider the areas of\neducation and health services. These are all areas of relevance to families\nand in which the family is encountered as a necessary relay in the\nimplementation of programs of social action. But family law has not been\ninterpreted as broadly as this. Instead, it focuses primarily on the more\ntraditional question of status and is thus primarily concerned with the means\nby which status is conferred, such as marriage, parenthood and cohabitation,\nand on the means by which status may alter, such as divorce or state action\nto remove children from parents. More recently, it has become concerned\nwith the problem of individuals abused by members of their own family. [Excerpts from: John Dewar, Law and the Family, 2nd ed, Butterworths,\nLondon, 1992, p.1-2]\n1.2 Rationale Behind Protection and Regulation of the Family\nThere are various reasons for regulating and protecting the family through the adoption of\nlegislative interventions. Before looking at these reasons it is necessary to define a\nfamily. The legal definition of family is not a unitary concept. However, we can find\nsome suggested definitions. Planiol defines a family as a group of persons who are united by marriage, by filiation or\neven, but exceptionally, by adoption.3 Another more or less similar definition is given by\nMurdok. In that definition, family is considered as ' a social group characterized by\ncommon residence, economic cooperation, and reproduction. It includes adults of both\nsexes, at least two of whom maintain a socially approved sexual relationship, and one and\nmore children, own or adopted, of the sexually cohabiting adults.

    "text": "1 part 1, 384 \n4 Murdok, Social Structure, (problems of the Family, 162\nFrom the definitions given above, one can categorize the family into nuclear and\nextended family. The first and basic type of family organization is the nuclear family. The nuclear family basically consists of a married man and woman with their\noffspring.5 ‘The nuclear family is a universal human social grouping. Either as\nthe sole prevailing form of the family or as the basic unit from which more\ncomplex familial forms are compounded, it existed as a distinct and strongly\nfunctional group in every known society. ’6\nAn extended family, on the other hand, consists of two or more nuclear families\naffiliated through an extension of the parent-child relationship rather than of the\nhusband-wife relationship, i.e, by joining the nuclear family of a married adult\n7\nto that of his parents. This way of defining the family has been criticized recently by many, especially by\nauthors in the western society, for its lack of accommodating the changes in the\ncircumstances and societal values. As will be seen shortly, establishing a family\nrelationship will have its own effects, like for instances on issues of child custody,\nmaintenance and other rights and obligations. Defining family in the above manner\nrestricts persons engaged in nontraditional relationships from having those rights and\nobligations. ( Harvard Law Review, vol 104, p 1642-1659)\nDo you believe that formation of the family needs to be regulated by the law? Why? Why\nnot? The family is a very important constitutive part of a society. It has natural, economic as\nwell as social importance. ‘ The state of the weakness and of destitution in which the child\nis born, the amount and length of care he needs, impose upon his parents duties which are\n5 problems of the Family, 162 \n6 Murdok, 163 \n7 Murdok 162-63. not fulfilled in one day and which create the solid foundation of all of the family\nrelation. ’8\nThe family is the nucleus of the society, and hence much depends on its safety and\nsecurity. As Planiol correctly notes, ‘the small family group is the most essential element\nof all those which compose the great agglomerations of men which are called nations. The family is the irreducible nucleus. And the whole is worth what it itself is worth. 9\nThough the family may contain\nWhen it is impaired or dissolved, all the rest crumbles.’ only few people, the impact that this unit has on the whole society is great.",

Due to the fact that the marital status as well as the family entails community rights and\nobligations far beyond those implicit in the ordinary civil contract, it is conceded that the\n10 As a result,\nstates may prescribe the conditions on which the status may be assumed. marriage laws are subject to the control of the state government; and the interest of the\nstate in the marriage of its citizens has long been recognized. ' The state, it is said, is a\nparty to every marriage. This means simply that the state is interested in the well ordered\nregulation of the family organization of the persons within its borders. '11\nThe state uses different means to regulate and control the formation as well as the effects\nof forming a family. One basic means of doing so is through legislations. Laws have\nvarious functions within a state. 'Laws do more than distribute rights, responsibilities, and punishments. Laws\nhelp to shape the public meanings of important institutions, including marriage\nand family. The best interdisciplinary studies of institutions conclude that social\ninstitutions are shaped and constituted by their shared public meanings. According to Nobel Prize winner Douglass North, institutions perform three\nunique tasks. They establish public norms or rules of the game that frame a\nparticular domain of human life. They broadcast these shared meanings to\n8 (planiol, 385)   \n9 (planiol, 386 \n10 (murdok, 76) \n11 (Marriage laws, 4 Albert Jackobs)\nsociety. Finally, they shape social conduct and relationships through these\nauthoritative norms.12\nHence, the state protects and regulates the family by using its legislative power. 1.4 Sources of Family Relationships\nWhat do you think are the different sources of family relationship? There are three sources of family relationships namely, marriage, filiation and adoption. The status of the persons as well as the rights and obligations of the persons differs with\nthe difference in the source of the relationship. This section deals with the different\nsources of family relationships and the effects of the relationships. 1.4.1 Relationship by consanguinity\nRelationship by consanguinity results from the birth. It is ‘the tie which exists between\ntwo persons, such as the son and the father, the grandson and the grandfather; or those\nwho descend from a common ancestor, such as two brothers, or two cousins. ’13\nHence, relationship by consanguinity is a natural fact which is derived from birth.",

    "text": "Excerpts from Planiol pages 387-389\nThe series of relatives who descend from each other form what is called a line. It is a\ndirect relationship: it is represented by a straight line going from one relative to the\nother, no matter how many intermediaries there may be. As to the relationship which\nunites two relatives descending from a common ancestor, it is called collateral\nrelationship: its graphic relationship is formed by an angle. The two relatives occupy the\ninferior extremity of the two sides and the common author is at the top. Two collateral\nrelatives are thus not in the same line; they form part of two different lines which started\nfrom the common author, who represents the point where the junction is made; the two\n12 (Future of family, 10) \n13 Planiol, 387\nlines travel side by side, which fact explains the word 'collateral'; each of the two\nrelatives is, in regard to the other, in a line parallel to his own, collateralis. … In each line relationship is counted by degrees, i.e. by generation. So the son and the\nfather are related in the first degree; the grandson and the grandfather in the second\ndegree, and so on. Method of calculation of relatives in the direct line is easy.: there are as many degrees as\nthere are generations going from one relative to the other. When it comes to collateral relationship there are two ways of computation. The one used\nby the civil law count the number of generations in the two lines by departing from the\ncommon ancestors and by adding the two series of degrees. Thus, two brothers are\nrelated in the second degree (one generation in each branch); an uncle and his nephew\nare related in the third degree….in the Canon law another way is used to compute the\ndegrees: the generations are counted only on one side. When the two lines are equal,\neither may be taken. When they are not equal, the longest one of the two is chosen and no\nattention is paid to the other. The result of this Canonical computation is that two first\ncousins are related in the second degree, while according to the civilian computation\nthey are related in the fourth degree…..\nThe following diagrams illustrate how the computation is to be undertaken\nGrandfather\nFather\nChild\nGrandchild\nTo reach to the degree of relationship between persons related in the direct line, we\nsimply count the number of lines between them.",

In calculating the degree of relationship in the collateral line, there are two way, which\nwill lead to different results. Let us have a look at the following diagram to have a clear\nunderstanding of the two systems\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nThe children of A are related in the collateral line. If we are using the Civil law system to\ncalculate the degree of relationship between B and C, who are brothers, we will add the\ntwo lines which are departing from the common ancestor A. Hence, B and C are related\nin the second degree. B, who is the uncle of E, is related to E in the third degree. And B is\nrelated to F in the fourth degree. On the other hand, if we use the Canon law, the result will be different. As mentioned\nearlier, the cannon law tells us to count only on one side. When the two lines are equal,\nwe will simply take one line. Accordingly, the degree of relationship between B and C is\none. Conversely, if the lines are not equal, the longest line is to be taken. Hence, in the\nabove diagram, B is related to F in the third degree. When we look into the Ethiopian Civil Code of 1960, it does not govern how the\nrelationship in the direct line is to be computed. Article 551 tries to give some highlight\non how the computation of relationship in the direct line is to be conducted. The Amharic\nversion of the Code states as follows\nየስጋ ዝምድና አቆጣጠር የጋራ ከሆነው የግንድ ወላጅ የዝምድና ደረጃ ጀምሮ\nግራና ቀኝ ካለው ትውልድ መስመር እስከ ሰባት ትውልድ ድረስ ነው፡፡\nHowever, this article only tells us that calculation of degree of relationship in consanguial\nline is to be done by taking the common ancestor as a bench mark. Does the Revised Federal Family Code regulate the manner of computation of degree of\nrelationship? Why do you think is the reason? 1.4.2 Relationship by Affinity\nRelationship by affinity is created as a result of marriage. ' Relatives through marriage\nare persons who are not relatives, but which join the family by means of a marriage.

' The two spouses are\nconsidered as being only one, so that all the relationships of the one become, by the\neffects of marriage, common to the other. '15\nOne thing which needs to be noted here is\nthe fact that the relationship created does not go beyond this. That means, a relationship\ndoes not exist between the relatives of one spouse with the relatives of the other spouse. 1.4.3 Relationship by Adoption\nRelationship by adoption is created as a result of a special contract between the adopter\nand the original families of the adopted child. Unlike blood relationship, it is a fictitious\nrelationship which resulted from the agreement of the parties to the adoption contract. However, it is also an imitation of the real relationship. Chapter eight deals in detail\nabout adoption, and hence, it is not necessary to go to the details under this section. 1.5 Effect of Family Relationship\nWhat do you think are some of the effects of family relationship? There are various effects which resulted from the relationship. Relationships give rights;\nthey also create obligations, and also carry incapacities. Hence, we can talk about three\neffects of a relationship: creation of rights, creation of obligations and making the related\npersons incapable of performing some juridical acts. Rights emanating from a relationship:- relationship results in the right of the relatives\nto take the estate of the deceased relative. That is to say, a right of succession is one of\nthe effects of a family relationship. Secondly, there is also the right of destitute relatives\nto get maintenance from the other relatives. Parents will also have a right over the person\nand the estate of their children. For instance, article 198 of the RFC provides that the\nobligation to supply maintenance exists between ascendants and descendants and also\nbetween persons who are related by affinity in the direct line. 15 Planiol, 392\nObligations emanating from relationship: there are also various obligations which will\nsubsist among the relatives. The first obligation is that of alimony. Relatives have the\nobligation to provide alimony for the destitute relatives who cannot have their own means\nof income. Moreover, there is also the duty on the parents to take custody and raise their\nchildren.",

    "text": "In this regard, article 219 of the RFC puts an obligation on the father and\nmother of the minor child to be the joint guardian and tutors during the life time of their\nmarriage. Taking custody of children also involves making decisions in respect of the\nhealth, education as well as social contacts of the child. Articles 255 and the following\narticles of the RFC provide by way of obligation on the parents to take care of the health,\nresidence, education as well as social contact of the minor child. On top of this, there may\nbe property inherited by the child. The parents or in their absence, the ascendants will\nhave the obligation to administer the property on behalf of the child. Apart from the above mentioned duties and rights, relationships may also result in\nincapacities of the persons involved. The law prohibits marriage between close relatives. The incapacity to marry is one type of incapacity resulting from relationship. Under 32 of\nthe RFC as well as the regional family codes relationship is provided as one essential\ncondition for the conclusion of marriage. Activity 1. Form a group of five and discuss amongst yourselves what family is in the\nEthiopian law and the sources of family relationship. Make sure to consult family laws of\nat least two regions. Activity 2. Discuss in groups the theories of computing family relationships. By drawing\na diagram, try to calculate the degree of relationship between you and your grandparents\non the one hand and between you and your nephews/nieces on the other hand. Use both\nthe canonical and civil law modes of computation. Chapter Two: Marriage\nIntroduction\nThe previous chapter, presented the meaning of family as well as the sources of\nrelationship of family. As you have correctly observed, one and the major source of\nfamily relationship is marriage. What is marriage? What are some of the conditions\nwhich need to be fulfilled to conclude marriage? Considering the difference in the custom\nand religion of the society, the FDRE Constitution as well as the Revised Family law\nrecognizes marriages as celebrated in accordance with the custom and religion of the\nspouses. One very important question which needs to be considered here is \"Are spouses\nwho are concluding their marriage according to their custom or religion required to\nobserve the essential conditions of marriage?\" what will happen if two persons proceed to\nconclude their marriage despite the non-fulfillment of one or more of the essential\nconditions? These and other related issues are the subject of discussion in this chapter.",

Mainly the betrothal was concluded between the parents of the\nfuture spouses. Betrothal is defined under article 560 of the civil code as a contract\nbetween the members of two families that a marriage shall take place between two\npersons, the fiancé and the fiancée, belonging to these two families. Hence, under the\nCivil Code, the betrothal contract is to be concluded between family members of the\nfuture spouses and more emphasis is given to the choice, consent and interest of these\nfamily members rather than the future spouses. Moreover, in many circumstances the\npractice shows that betrothal was concluded when the future spouses are underage and\nsometimes not yet born.16\nThis means, the interest and choice of the future spouses was\nnot considered at all. On the other hand, the Constitution of 1995 recognizes the right of individuals to form a\nfamily with their own free and full consent. As result, the provisions of the Civil Code\ndealing with betrothal were found to be contrary to this fundamental right of individuals. Hence, the RFC has excluded the concept of betrothal as a whole. However, some regional family codes maintain the concept of betrothal with\nmodification. The major modification made relates to the definition given to betrothal. All the regional laws which incorporated the concept of betrothal defined it as a pact\n17\nbetween the fiancé and fiancée to conclude marriage sometime in the future. This is\nunlike the definition given by the Civil Code which involves only the parents or\nguardians of the future spouses. The Family Code of the Amhara region requires the contract of betrothal to be made in a\n18\nwritten form signed by four family witnesses, two from each side.",

This may be either in writing or orally, whichever is\ncustomarily practiced in the region. When we look into article 4 of the SNNP regional\nfamily code, both options are included. The family codes have also provided a time framework for the duration of the betrothal. Article 6 of the SNNP family code leaves it open for the parties to determine the duration\nof betrothal. However, if the parties fail to mention the time for the conclusion of\nmarriage, it requires them to tie the pact within a year after the conclusion of the betrothal\ncontract. The family code of the Benishangul Gumuz, on the other hand, gives only six\nmonths after the conclusion of the betrothal contract. The time framework given under\narticle 6 of the Amhara regional family code is two years. Hence, the marriage has to be\nconcluded within two years following the betrothal contract. The family codes have also envisaged a situation for the invalidation of the betrothal\ncontract. If one of the parties to the betrothal contract communicate their intention to\ninvalidate the betrothal, or refuse to conclude marriage within the intended period or\nengaged in any act to impede the conclusion of marriage, the betrothal contract will be\ninvalidated.19\nThe consequences of breach of the contract are also illustrated in the\nsubsequent articles. 2.2 Definition of Marriage\nThe family in the Ethiopian Constitution is recognized as the natural and fundamental\nunit of a society and an important legal and social institution. As a result, it is given legal\nprotection. One thing that should be noted here is that a marriage may be regarded as\n20\neither a status or a contract. As Jonathan Herring noted\nMarriage could be regarded as either a status or a contract. In law a status\nis regarded as a relationship which has a set of legal consequences which\nflow automatically from that relationship, regardless of the intention of the\nparties.",

The alternative approach would be to regard contract as\ngoverning marriage. The legal consequences of marriage would then flow\nfrom the intentions of the parties as set out in an agreement rather than any\ngiven rules set down by the law. Marriage is perhaps best regarded as a mixture of the two. There are some\nlegal consequences which flow automatically from marriage and other\nconsequences which depend on the agreement of the parties. The law sets\nout: who can marry, when the relationship can be ended and what are the\nconsequences for the parties of being married. In Ethiopia, marriage is regarded in both the Civil Code. The Revised Family Code and\nthe regional family codes as an institution, rather than a contract.21\nHowever, when it\ncomes to defining this institution, neither laws are helpful. Hence, to have a common\nunderstanding of the institution, it is necessary to resort to the definitions given by other\nforeign laws. In the English legal system, marriage, as defined by Sir James Wilde in the land mark\ncase of Hyde Vs Hyde, is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the\n22\nexclusion of all others. This same definition is also upheld under the Australian\nMarriage Act of 1961. The definitional part as well as Section 46 of the Australian\nMarriage act defines marriage as the voluntary union of one man and one woman for life\nto the exclusion of others. This definition has been taken from the English definition of\nmarriage. Both definitions contain three common elements. First, the marriage has to be\nconcluded between a man and a woman, there is no legal marriage between same sex\npersons. Secondly, the institution of marriage is to be entered into with the absolute\nconsent of the parties i.e., voluntarily. In addition, the marriage is expected to last for a\nlife time, death being the only cause for dissolution. 21 Tilahun Teshome, International survey of family, 157 \n22 definition of marriage in UK, 1).",

    "text": "The Philippines Family Code of 1987, on the other hand, defines marriage as a special\ncontract of permanent union between a man and a woman entered into in accordance with\nlaw for the establishment of conjugal and family life.23\nIn addition to the elements that\nare present in the English and Australian definition of marriage, the Philippines family\ncode considers the establishment of conjugal and family life as essential elements for\nmarriage. The definitions given by the different legal systems have their own shortcomings. All the\ndocuments tend to be ideal in the sense they expect the union to last for life, while in\nreality marriages breakdown for different reasons other than death. Moreover, the central\naim of concluding marriage seems to be establishment of a family, while in reality, some\n24\ncouples conclude marriage knowing that they cannot have their own children. Taking into account the insufficiency of the definitions given by many foreign laws, the\nEthiopian legislature opted not to give any definition at all. Look into Chapter One section two of the RFC and try to infer a definition which may\nincorporate various aspects of family. 2.3 Modes of Conclusion of Marriage\nThe Revised Federal Family Code as well as the Regional Family Codes recognized three\nmodes of conclusion of marriage. These are: Civil Marriage, Religious Marriage and\nCustomary Marriage. 2.3.1 Civil Marriage (Marriage Concluded before an Officer of Civil Status)\nFor a marriage to be considered as being concluded before an officer of civil status, a\nman and a woman need to appear before the officer for the purpose of concluding\n25\nHence, the phrase\nmarriage and give their respective consent to enter into marriage. 23 article 1, Family Code of Phillipines \n24 Mehari p. 12 \n25 article 2 of the RFC\ncivil marriage basically refers to the fact that the marriage has been solemnized in front\nof an officer who is empowered to accept the consent of parties wishing to enter into\nmarriage. The 1960 Ethiopian Civil Code provides for the establishment and the duties of the office\nof civil status. However, implementations of the provisions which deal with this office\nhave been made to wait for the issuance of an Order to be published in the Negarit\nGazeta, which has never come into life.26\nAs a result, currently there is no established\noffice of civil status. In municipal areas, the functions of the officer of civil status are\nassumed and performed by the municipalities. For instance in Addis Ababa the offices of\nthe Kifle ketemas are the ones who oversee the performance of civil marriages.",

    "text": "In order to conclude civil marriage, there are certain formalities and requirements which\nare stipulated by the RFC. The first formality is that of a residence. Pursuant to article 22\nof the code, civil marriage is concluded before the officer of civil status of the place\nwhere one of the future spouses or one of the ascendants or close relatives of one of them\nhas established a residence by continuously living there for not less than six months\nbefore the conclusion of the marriage. Hence, the solemnization of a civil marriage is to\nbe conducted in the place in which one of the aforementioned has established a residence\nfor a minimum of six months. Residence, on the other hand is defined by the Civil Code\n27 The code also tries to distinguish between\nas the place where a person normally resides. residing in a place and a mere sojourn in a particular place. In determining existence of a\nresidence, the notion of normality and intention of the person concerned are vital. In\naddition to this, article 175/2 requires staying in a particular place for a minimum of three\nmonths to constitute residence. ‘ Although the code does not settle the point, it seems that\nthe period of three months must be uninterrupted. ’28\nHowever, when it is for the purpose\nof conclusion of marriage, this article of the Civil Code is qualified by virtue of article 22\nof the RFC. As a result, those persons enumerated under article 22 of the RFC have to\nreside in the place for a continuous period of six months. This article also answers the\nquestion as to whether the period should be interrupted or uninterrupted one. 26 Article 3361 of the Civil Code \n27 article 174 civil code \n28 Vanderlinden, Law of Persons, 34\nThe other formality is that of giving notice. The RFC requires the future spouses to\ninform the officer of Civil Status of their intention to conclude marriage not less than a\nmonth before the celebration of the marriage.29\nThe purpose of notifying the officer is to\nmake sure that there are no impediments to the conclusion of marriage and to allow\nanyone who want to oppose to the marriage to do so in accordance with the law. This can\nbe understood from the requirement on the part of the officer to publicize the notification\nstipulated under the same article as well as the subsequent articles of the Code. The process of notification and waiting period (or the formal requirements for conclusion\nof marriage before an officer of civil status) are available in other countries’ laws as well.",

    "text": "For instance, all states in America prescribe some formalities for conclusion of marriage. 30\nAnd the regulations are categorized into two classes: licensure and solemnization. As Ellman et al put it:\n‘All states have marriage license laws. Applicants provide certain\ninformation to a governmental office concerning age, prior relationship by\nblood or marriage, previous marriage etc. This information helps in\ncompiling vital statistics and could facilitate enforcement of substantive\nmarriage regulations by permitting the clerk to screen out ineligible\napplicants. For example, if the application revealed the bride and groom\nwere siblings, the license would be denied under laws prohibiting incestuous\nmarriages. In practice, the license law does little to restrain intentional\nviolation of substantive regulations, because little effort is made to confirm\n31\nthe truth of the license application information.’ On the issue of waiting period, the authors have noted that:\n‘Most states impose a waiting period (of either 3 or 5 days), either between\nthe application and issuance of the license or between issuance and\nperformance of the ceremony. … the waiting period requirement as well as\n29 article 23 of the RFC \n30 Ira mark Ellman, Family Law: cases, text, Problems, 56 \n31 Ira Mrk Ellman, family law cases…, 56-57\nthe entire licensing procedure is explained as impressing upon the parties the\nseriousness of the entry into marriage. ’32\nThe 1949 Marriage Act of the UK also stipulates some formalities for conclusion of\nmarriage.

One requirement stipulated under article 25 of the RFC is that the future spouses have to\npersonally appear for the solemnization process. In connection to this requirement, the\nissue of proxy marriages can be raised. Do you think that the future spouses need to be present before the officer of Civil status to\ncelebrate their marriage? Is it always mandatory for the future spouses to be present or\nis it possible to conclude marriage through representation? The question of whether marriage can be concluded by proxy is of little practical\nimportance in modern times. However, there may be circumstances which would\nnecessitate the use of representation for marriage. Historically, the late Roman law and\n32 Ira mark Ellman, 57 \n33 John Dewar, Law and the Family, (1992), 34 \n34 Section 28 of the marriage Act of 1949. 35 Article 25/1 of RFC\nthe Canon law allowed in a clear manner celebration of marriage by proxy. In the words\nof Pomponius:36\nA man who was away from home might marry a woman by letter or\nmessenger, but marriage could not be contracted in this manner by a woman\nwho was absent from the man's place of residence. The reason for this\ndifference between the man and the woman resulted from the requirement of\nthe Roman law that the wife be led to the husband's home. The Code Napoleon, on the other, does not prohibit proxy marriage in express terms. It\nsimply puts an obligation on the officer of civil status to read the parties the requirement\nof the law with respect to marriage and the mutual right and duties of the parties which\n37 In order to achieve this purpose, it seems that the parties\nemanates from the marriage. need to personally be present at the ceremony. However, some French writers held the\nview that in the absence of express provision which made marriage concluded by proxy\nvoid, it should be considered as valid.38\nMarriage by representation is necessary when one of the parties cannot be present for the\nceremony. ‘ While its most prominent use has been in wartime with one party on duty\n39\noverseas, sometimes it is used by prisoners.’ The First World War was the main reason\nfor many European countries to allow in their laws for the conclusion of marriage\nthrough representation.",

One way\nof achieving this purpose is by requesting the witnesses to confirm under oath the\nfulfillment of these conditions. As can be grasped from the next sub-article, the taking of\n40 Lorenzen, 479 \n41 Article 12/1 cum article 25/1 RFC \n42 Article 25/3.

The third formality requirement for celebration of civil marriages is that the future\nspouses need to declare openly that they have consented to enter into the marriage. Marriage is an institution which is to be entered into by the parties of their free will. The\nexistence of their free will has to be openly communicated to the officer of civil status. Apart from the open communication of their will, the future spouses as well as the\nwitnesses are required to sign in the register of the Civil Status.43\nAfter the fulfillment of all the above mentioned formalities, what is left is for the Officer\n44\nof civil status to pronounce them united in marriage and issue a certificate of marriage. 2.3.2 Religious Marriage\nThe second type of marriage which is given recognition by the RFC is religious marriage. Pursuant to article 3 of the RFC, a religious marriage takes place when a man and a\nwoman have performed such acts or rites as deemed to constitute a valid marriage by\ntheir religion or by the religion of one of them. As a result, the formal requirements for\nthe conclusion of religious marriage are dictated by the religion itself. This is further\ncorroborated by article 26/1. Hence, the conclusion of the religious marriage as well as\nthe formalities to be followed are as prescribed by the concerned religion. However, one\nshould note here that the essential conditions that are stipulated by the RFC need to be\n45\nobserved whatever the manner of celebration of marriage is. 2.3.3 Customary Marriage\nEthiopia is a nation which is believed to be home for more than eighty nationalitites.

    "text": "Particularly,\n43 Article 25/5 of the RFC \n44 Article 25/6 of the RFC \n45 See article 26/2 of the RFC\nArticle 34/4 of the Constitution stipulates for the enactment of a specific law which gives\nrecognition to marriage concluded under systems of religious or customary laws. In light\nof this obligation, the RFC gives the future spouses the option to conclude their marriage\nin accordance with customary practices. Pursuant to Article 4 of the RFC marriage according to custom takes place when a man\nand a woman have performed such rites as deemed to constitute valid marriage by the\ncustom of the community in which they live or by the custom of the community to which\nthey belong or to which one of them belong. One important thing which needs to be\nnoted here is that for a marriage to be concluded according to custom, the custom referred\nto is of three: the custom of the community in which they live, or the custom of the\ncommunity to which both future spouses belong or alternatively to which one of them\nbelong. This is in contradistinction to the Civil Code of 1960. Article 580 of the Civil\nCode considers a marriage to be customary marriage when it is concluded under the rules\nof the community to which the future spouses belong or to which one of them belongs. Defining customary marriage in such manner has the effect of excluding marriages\nconcluded by two persons belonging to a certain tribe but the marriage was concluded\nusing the rites of a different tribe. For instance if a man from the Oromo tribe concludes\nmarriage with a woman from the Tigray tribe and the marriage was concluded in Amhara\nregion by fulfilling the rites of the Amhara tribe, such marriage will not be considered as\na customary marriage concluded by fulfilling the requirements of the Amhara tribe,\nbecause neither of the spouses belong to that tribe. Considering the shortcoming of article\n580 of the Civil Code, the RFC included the custom of the community in which the\nparties are living at the time of conclusion of marriage. The conclusion of the marriage as well as the formalities, hence, is to be prescribed by\nthe concerned community.

As a result, article 5 of RFC provides for the recognition of marriages\nwhich are celebrated abroad as valid in Ethiopia. Here, two things are worth mentioning. The marriage whose recognition is sought in Ethiopia has to be concluded by fulfilling\nthe legal requirements of the place of celebration. This can be gathered from the phrase\n‘…in accordance with the law of the place of celebration…’. Hence, when recognition of\nthe marriage is sought, it has to first be identified whether the legal requirements of the\nplace of celebration were fulfilled. Moreover, the law puts public morality of the\nEthiopian people as a limitation on the recognition of marriages celebrated abroad. That\nis to say, the foreign marriage will be recognized in Ethiopia only in respect of its\n46 A good example here is the case of same-sex\nformality and not as to its substance. marriage. Some western countries and one African country47\nhave made same-sex\nmarriage lawful. Hence same-sex marriages could be concluded lawfully in these\ncountries. However, these types of marriages cannot be recognized in Ethiopia for\ndifferent grounds. First, the law, though indirectly, considers marriage to be a union\nbetween a man and a woman, not between the same sexes. Hence, same-sex marriage\ndoes not fulfill the definitional requirement of marriage under Ethiopian law. Secondly,\narticle 629 of the new criminal Code made sexual activity and any indecent act with\n46 Mehari Redae, 17 \n47 Republic of South Africa is the only country in Africa and the fifth in the world to make same-\nsex marriage lawful.

For stronger reason, marriage between same sexes will\nbe prohibited. In addition to this, article 5 of the RFC provides for the recognition of\nmarriages celebrated abroad as far as doing so will not be contrary to public morality. The ground for criminalizing sexual activity between same sexes is that it is repugnant to\nthe morality of the Ethiopian people. For the grounds discussed above, marriage between\nsame sexes will not be recognized in Ethiopia. Can we apply article 5 of the RFC to marriages concluded in the regions by way of\nanalogy? 2.4 Essential Conditions of Marriage\nEssential conditions for validity of marriage pertainto biological, psychological and\nsociological factors.48 The biological factors relate to age, sex and state of health of the\nfuture spouses, whereas the psychological factor relates to the freedom of will of the\nparties.",

    "text": "On the other hand, the sociological aspect pertains to issues like marriage\nbetween persons related by consanguinity and affinity as well as by adoption and it also\nincorporates bigamy. When we come to the sources of such restriction, O’Donovan had\nthe following to say49\n:\nSuch impediments were known to the Feteha Negest and covered obstacles to\nthe union arising from prior relationships, from previous marriage, or from age. Also included were defects arising from the ceremony itself. Such marriages\nwere prohibited and in some cases gave rise to penal sanctions. Many of the\nimpediments found in the Feteha Negest have been retained in the Civil Code. But those related only to the rules of religion have been dropped. 48 Tilahun Teshome, International Survey of family law, 159 \n49 O’Donovan, 442\nThe essential conditions that are found in the RFC are derived from the Civil Code,\nwhich in turn is derived from the Feteha Negest. So we can say that most of the\nconditions are derived from the Feteha Negest. In the following sub topics, discussion will be made on these essential conditions for the\nconclusion of a valid marriage. 2.4.1 Consent\nMarriage is an institution which is to be entered into by the parties with their free and full\nconsent. The UN Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum age of Marriage and\nRegistration of marriage as well as the Recommendation of the UN General Assembly\nwhich was adopted in 1965 provide consent as a prerequisite for the conclusion of\nmarriage. Pursuant to article 1 of the UN Convention, no marriage shall be legally entered into\nwithout the full and free consent of both parties. This requirement is further strengthened\nby the Recommendation. The Convention as well as the Recommendation put an\nobligation on member states to make sure that future spouses have decided, of their free\nwill and consent, to enter into marriage. One way of compliance with this obligation is\nthe harmonization of domestic laws in line with the international commitments of the\ncountries. Ethiopia is one of the countries who have acceded to this Convention. As a\nresult, the Constitution as well as the RFC and the regional family codes incorporate\nconsent as a validity requirement of marriage. In some parts of Ethiopia, the culture does not require the consent of the future spouses\nfor conclusion of marriage; rather what really matters is the willingness of their parents to\ntie their children in bond of marriage.50\nIn effect many marriages have been concluded\nnot on the basis of the willingness of the spouses but of their parents.",

    "text": "This has been\nconsidered as a ground for many disputes in families. Considering this deep rooted\nculture, many efforts have been made to bring change, particularly through the use of\nlegislations. In this respect what comes in the fore front is the 1995 Constitution. Article\n34/2 of the Constitution reiterates the requirement that marriages should be entered into\n50 Mehari redae, 18-19\nupon the free and full consent of the parties. In addition to this the RFC considers the free\nand full consent of the parties as a validity requirement for conclusion of marriage. When the international as well as domestic legal instruments require existence of consent\nas a requirement for marriage, it implies that ‘there must be no duress or force inducing\nthe marriage or any misunderstanding as to the effect of the marriage ceremony. ’51\nHence, the RFC recognizes some grounds which would vitiate the consent of the spouses. o Fundamental Error\nThe first ground which is considered as a base for vitiating consent of the parties is error. However, it is not all types of errors which would vitiate the consent, rather, as per article\n13/2 of the RFC; the error has to be a fundamental one. What the law considers to be\nfundamental errors are illustrated under sub article 3 of article 13. These include:\n1. Error on the identity of the spouse where it is not the person with whom a\nperson intended to conclude marriage: - here the mistake has to be as to\nidentity rather than as to attribute. Cases of impersonation can be\nconsidered as fundamental error falling under this category. However, if\nthe error pertains to the attribute of the person like for instance if one party\nmistakenly thought that the other was rich, it can not be considered as a\nfundamental error as per the requirement of the article and hence, will not\nbe a ground to invalidate the marriage. 2. Error on the state of health of the spouse who is affected by a disease that\ndoes not heal or can be genetically transmitted to descendants:-\n3. Error on the bodily confirmation of the spouse who does not have the\nrequisite sexual organ for the consummation of the marriage\n4. Error on the behavior of the spouse who has the habit of performing\nsexual acts with person of the same sex. o Violence (Duress)\nThe other ground which would vitiate the consent of spouses to enter into marriage is\nviolence. If the consent to marry was extracted by violence, it cannot be said that the\nparty has freely consented to the marriage.",

Kronby, Canadian family Law, 7th ed. 1997, Stoddart Publishing c., 5\nmarriage concluded when consent is extorted by violence as an invalid marriage. Moreover, the article further illustrates situations which might lead the court to determine\nwhether the consent was extorted by violence or not. Hence, if the consent was given to\nprotect himself/herself or one of his/her ascendants or descendants or any other close\nrelative from a serious and imminent danger or thereat of danger, it can be said that the\nconsent was extorted by violence. Some of the issues which need further clarification on consent extorted by violence\ninclude the following52\n. i. What must the threat or fear be of? At one time it was thought that it was\nonly possible for duress to render a marriage voidable if there was a threat\nto life, limb or property. Recently the court of appeal in Hirani vs Hirani\nsuggested that the test for duress should focus on the effect of the threat\nrather that the nature of the threat. In other words, the threat can be of any\nkind, but it must be shown that the threats, pressure or whatever it is, is\nsuch as to destroy the reality of the consent and overbear the will of the\nindividual. In the case of Hirani vs. Hirani the court accepted that social\npressure could overbear the consent. The woman was threatened with\nostracisation by her community and her family if she did not go through\nwith the marriage and the fear of complete social isolation was such that\nthere was no true consent. The effect of the Hirani decision is that those\nwho have undergone an arranged marriage in the face of a serious threat\nhave the choice of either accepting their culture and the validity of their\nmarriage or accepting dominant culture’s view that marriage should be\nmade voidable. This could be regarded as an appropriate compromise\nbetween respecting the cultural practice of arranged marriages and\nrespecting people’s right to choose whom to marry. ii. Must the fear be reasonably held? What if threat was made, but a\nreasonable person would not have taken it seriously? In Szcher it was\nsuggested that duress could not be relied upon unless the fear was\nreasonably held. Against this is Scott v Selbright in which it was\n52 Jonathan herring, family law, 2001, pearson education limited, 49-51\nsuggested that as long as the beliefs of threats were honestly held, duress\ncould be relied upon.",

The thereat can emanate from a third\nparty; it need not emanate from the spouse. o Judicial Interdiction\nJudicial interdiction exists in the cases where a person is insane according to article 339\nof the Civil Code and where he has bee n interdicted by the court. The court orders\ninterdiction of the person because his health and his interest so requires or because his\nheirs’ interest so require.53 These two conditions have to simultaneously be present for\nthe court to give order of interdiction. The order of interdictions means the interdicted\nperson will have lessened capacity and hence need to be protected. ‘ The basic idea\nunderlying these protective measures is to ensure that the physical person who holds\nrights and duties but cannot exercise them is provided with the assistance of some other\nperson who shall act on his behalf in most acts of juridical life. ’54As a result of the\nlessened capacity, an interdicted person may conclude marriage only with the\nauthorization of the court.55\n2.4.2 Age\nAs discussed above, under Ethiopian law, marriage is an institution to be entered into by\nthe full and free consent of the parties. In order to freely consent to the marriage, the\nparties should understand the consequences of their acts, and hence need to attain a\ncertain age. The Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum age of Marriage and\nRegistration of Marriage under the preamble, by making cross reference to the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights provides that it is only those men and women who attained\nfull age who can enter into marriage.

Specifying the minimum age for\nmarriage is left for the individual countries to govern through legislation.56\nHowever, this\npower of the state is not without any limitations. As can be seen from the\nRecommendation on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration\nof Marriages, General Assembly resolution 2018 (XX), principle II, Member States shall\ntake legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage, which in any case shall not\nbe less than fifteen years of age.",

    "text": "Hence, the minimum marriageable age in any country\nwill be 15 years, though it can be set at higher age than this. There are different reasons which can be raised as a ground for limiting the minimum\nmarriageable age of spouses. ‘The standard justification for age restrictions has been the claim that\n“[m]arriage involving teenagers are more unstable than other marriages and\nare more likely to end in divorce than other marriages.” It is not clear,\nhowever, that the youth of the participants is what causes their marital\nfailure. A number of studies point to non-age related factors as important\npredictors of marital failure.’ 57\nWhen we come to the RFC, the minimum marriageable age is 18 years for both sexes. Hence, any person who has not attained the full age of 18 years may not conclude a valid\nmarriage. However, there are circumstances in which a valid marriage could be\nconcluded without the fulfillment of this requirement. This is provided as an exception\nunder sub article two. If the Minister of Justice, for serious cause, grants for dispensation,\non application of the future spouses, or the parents or guardian of one of them, marriage\ncould be validly concluded. The dispensation, however, may not be more than two years. This means, the maximum year that can be dispensed by the Minister is 2 years, and\nhence, the lowest age of marriage can be 16 years. This exception provided under the RFC is in line with the power given to states by the\nConvention as well as the Recommendation.

The very basic question here is as to how the serious cause can be identified. 2.4.3 Relationship\nThe other essential condition for the conclusion of marriage is relationship, or rather the\nexistence of prohibited degrees. Although it would be true to  say that restrictions on certain types of sexual\nrelations are a universal feature of primitive and advanced societies, it\nshould be remembered that ‘this must be understood as meaning that some\nsort of prohibition on mating is universal, not that a particular set of\nrelations is universally tabooed’.",

    "text": "Thus a wide variety of restrictions are\npossible, ranging from ‘elementary’ systems in which prohibitions on certain\nrelations are accompanied by a requirement that individuals marry only from\nwithin a certain group, to ‘complex’ systems in which only certain relations\nare excluded and the choice of partner is left to the individual.58\nIn many societies across the world there are laws which prohibit marriage between\npeople who are related. The same is true in Ethiopia. The restrictions under the RFC are\nbased on two groups of relations: those based on blood relationships i.e. consanguinity\nand those based on marriage, i.e. affinity. These restrictions were also maintained under\nthe 1960 Civil Code, though with a different degree of restriction. The prohibited consanguinity restrictions involve marriage between persons related in the\n59\ndirect line between ascendants and descendants. Hence, marriage between parent and\nchild, grandparent and grandchild is prohibited. On the collateral line, article 8/2\nprohibits marriage between a man and his sister or aunt and also a woman and her brother\nor uncle. 58 John Dewar, 45 \n59 Article 8/1 of the RFC\nThere are different reasons given for prohibiting marriage between related persons. The\nfirst argument is the fear of genetic danger involved in permitting procreation between\nclose blood relatives.60 In technologically advanced countries, however, it is argued that\nthe availability of genetic screening could avert the danger, and hence the restriction\ncannot be supported.61\n62\nThe other arguments raised for the restriction include\n‘…permitting marriage between close relations may undermine the security of\nthe family. The argument is that children should be brought up without the\npossibility of approved sexual relations latter in life with the members of their\nfamily. The third argument can be based on the widespread instinctive moral\nreaction against such relationships.’ At the time of debating on the draft RFC, the reason for restriction as well as up to what\ndegree the restriction should be was discussed thoroughly. Under the 1960 Civil Code,\nmarriage between ascendants and descendants as well as collaterals up to the 7th degree\nwas prohibited. Some suggested that the ground for this restriction is Christianity and the\nculture of the Northern parts of the country, and hence is not representative of the whole\n63\nHowever, as discussed above, the restriction is also available in other countries\nsociety. of the world and is also supported by medical evidence. Hence, in order to reconcile the\ndifferent religions and culture in the country with the science a limited restriction as far\nas collaterals is concerned, is adopted by the RFC.",

On the collateral line, marriage between a man and the sister of\nhis wife, and a woman and the brother of her husband is also prohibited. When we\nanalyze the restriction in light of the grounds for restriction, not all the arguments hold\nwater.

Hence, it can be\n60 John Dewar, 46 \n61 Herring, 38 \n62 Herring, 38 \n63 Mehaari, 23 \n64 Dewar, 46\nargued that the reason for such prohibition in the affiny is one of moral, rather than\nscientific. 2.4.4 Bigamy\nThe other essential condition for the conclusion of a valid marriage is the absence of prior\nmarriage. As stipulated under article 11 of the RFC, a person is not allowed to conclude\nmarriage when he is bound by the bonds of a preceding marriage. Many countries have\nlaws which prohibit bigamous marriages. For instance, if we look at article 35/4\ncumulative article 41 of the Family Code of the Philippines of 1987 contraction of\nmarriage by a person during subsistence of a previous marriage makes the subsequent\nmarriage null and void. On the issue of bigamy Herring has the following to say in relation to the English law\nIf at the time of the ceremony either party is already married to someone else,\nthe ‘marriage’ will be void. The marriage will remain void even if the first\nspouse dies during the second ‘marriage’. So if a person is married and\nwishes to marry someone else, he or she must obtain a decree of divorce or\nwait until the death of his or her spouse. If the first marriage is void it is\ntechnically not necessary to obtain a court order to that effect before\nmarrying again, but that is normally sought to avoid any uncertainty. In case\nof bigamy, as well as the purported marriage being void, the parties may\nhave committed the crime of bigamy. Many cultures do permit polygamous marriages, although in British society\nmonogamous marriages are the accepted norm. There are concrete\nobjections to polygamous marriages. Some argue that polygamy may create\ndivisions within the family, with one husband or wife vying for dominance\nover the other, and particularly that divisions may arise between the children\nof different parents.",

    "text": "Supporters of polygamous marriage argue that polygamy\nlead to less divorce and provide a wider family support network in which to\nraise children. Polygamy could also be regarded as a form of sex\ndiscrimination unless both men and women were permitted to take more than\none spouse. There have also been suggestions that permitting polygamous\nmarriages involves an insult to the religious sensitivities of the majority. These arguments in favor and against polygamous marriages were also reflected at the\ntime of debating on the draft RFC. Ethiopia is a multi religious and multi cultural\ncountry. Some consider condemnation of polygamous marriage against their culture and\nreligious beliefs. Some followers of Islam religion were arguing at the time of the debate\nthat it would be against the right that they obtain by virtue of their religion, and hence\npolygamous marriages should not be prohibited. However, there was also division of\nopinion on the part of the followers of Islam on this.65 On the other hand, female right\nadvocates were arguing that it is against the Constitutional right of female to allow\npolygamous marriage.66\nTaking into account the diverse views on the issue, the law opted\nfor the first view. Hence, for a person to conclude a valid marriage there should not be a\npreceding marriage. 2.4.5 Period of Widowhood\nThe concept introduced here by the legislature relates to the fact that a woman is under\nprohibition to remarry within the next one hundred and eighty days following the\ndissolution of her former marriage.67\nThis condition was also included in the Civil Code\nof 1960 and was subject to criticisms from different parties, particularly from female\nright advocates. They construe this provision as limiting the right of female to conclude\nmarriage at any time she wants, mainly because the limitation does not apply for males. However, when one looks into the rationale for this restriction, it will be clear that the\nlimitation is nit designed to discriminate between the two sexes. The rationale for the limitation under article 16 is to respect the right of children\nenshrined in the Constitution and other international human right instruments to which\nEthiopia is a party. Article 36/1/c of the 1995 FDRE Constitution provides that each child\nhas the right to know and be cared for by his/her parent or legal guardian.

In order to respect the right of children and\nalso to comply with the presumption, it is necessary to avoid any circumstances which\nwould create a doubt as to who the father of that child is.68\nHence, by requiring the\nfemale to wait for a period of 180 days following the dissolution of a previous marriage,\nthe law tries to avid any conflict of paternity. Taking into account the modern advances of medical science in which the existence of\npregnancy can easily be identified, it may be argued that the condition is unnecessary. However, we have to also look into the fact that many women in the country do not have\naccess to facilities providing the service. In addition to this, the article also provides for\nsome exceptional circumstances in which the 180 days restriction need not be observed. The first of such exceptions is if the woman gives birth after the dissolution of marriage\n69 In such a situation, it is presumed that the child is\nand before the lapse of the 180 days. born from the previous marriage and hence there will not be any conflict on paternity. Hence, she may remarry even before the 180 days lapsed. Remarrying the former\nhusband will also avoid the conflict on paternity and hence if the woman is marrying her\nprevious husband, she may do so without waiting for the 180 days. In addition to this, if\nshe can prove by medical evidence that she is not pregnant, she need not wait for the\nlapse of the specified time before concluding another marriage.70\nTaking into account the\nfact that it is impossible to list all the grounds which may dispense a woman from\nobserving the period of widowhood, the law gives discretion for the court to dispense her\nfrom observing the this requirement for any other valid reason. 2.5 Opposition to Marriage\nAs discussed earlier, marriage is an institution to be entered into with the full and free\nconsent of the parties. This assertion suggests that it is primarily the parties themselves\nwho will have a say on whether they should be joined by matrimony or not. However,\n68 Mehari, 30 \n69 Article 16/2/a of the RFC \n70 Article 16/2/c\nfrom our discussion on chapter one, what we can also infer is that the society and the\nstate also have interest in the marriage of the two individuals.

    "text": "The law, by way of\nregulating the relationship, has provided certain conditions which are essential for the\nvalidity of a marriage. The society as well as the executive organ of the government, on\nthe other hand, has the obligation to oversee the observance of these essential conditions\nprior to the conclusion of the marriage. In the following section the discussion will focus on as to who may bring an opposition\nfor the conclusion of marriage, to whom this opposition may be made, when this\nopposition should be made and the form of the opposition. Who may oppose? Depending on the essential condition which is violated, the persons who may oppose to\nthe conclusion of the marriage differ. When the condition violated is age, there are\npotentially three groups of persons who are given the right to oppose. The first one is the\nparents of the minor. If one of the future spouses have not attained the minimum\nmarriageable age stipulated by the law i.e. 18 years, then the parents of that minor may\noppose to the marriage. In many instances underage marriages are arranged by the\nparents of the minor themselves. In such situations obviously other persons should be\ngiven the right to oppose for the marriage. This is where the public prosecutor comes into\npicture. Apart from the fact the parents of the minor are involved in the planning of the\nmarriage and hence not opposing to its conclusion; underage marriage is considered as a\ncriminal act. Moreover, the state has also the obligation to see the respect for the essential\nconditions of marriage. Therefore, the law gives the public prosecutor the right to oppose\nthe underage marriage. Last but very importantly, the law gives ‘any other interested\nperson’ a right to oppose the underage marriage. Here, one very important question is as\nto who can this ‘any interested person’ be. Does it refer to any passerby or it has\nqualifications? In civil suits persons who may by plaintiffs are qualified under article 33/2 of the Civil\nProcedure Code. This article requires a person to have a vested interest in the subject\nmatter of the suit, to be qualified as a plaintiff. That is to say, the outcome of the suit has\nto affect the person either positively or negatively so that he can be the real party in the\nsuit. Article 18/a of the RFC should also be construed in this manner even if we are not\ntalking about court proceedings.",

    "text": "As a result, when the law refers to ‘any other interested\nperson’ it refers to those parties who may be directly or indirectly affected by the\nconclusion of the underage marriage. Under this group are included those NGOs which\nare working on the prevention of underage marriages.71\nIf they oppose the conclusion of\nan underage marriage, it means they are achieving one of the goals of their establishment,\nand hence making them an interested party. When the essential condition violated is relationship by consanguinity or affinity, the\nright to oppose the marriage is given to the ascendants of both or one of the future\nspouses  as well as their brothers  and sisters who have attained the full age of 18 years. Apart from these persons, the public prosecutor, as the organ having the obligation to\nsafeguard the interest of the society and the state, is given the right to oppose this\nmarriage. In cases of bigamous marriages, there are two persons who may oppose. The first one is\n72\nthe previous wife or husband of the bigamous spouse. Bigamy is considered under the\ncriminal code of 2004 as a crime, unless it is justified by the religion or custom of the\nperson. Hence, the public prosecutor has some interest in the prevention of conclusion of\nthis kind of marriage. As a result, article 18 also provides the public prosecutor a right to\noppose such marriages. In the case of judicial interdiction, it is the guardian of the interdicted person and the\n73\npublic prosecutor who may oppose to the marriage. As we can see from the above discussions, the persons who have the right to oppose\nconclusion of marriage is different with the difference in the type of condition violated,\nwith the exception of the public prosecutor.

    "text": "The Amharic version of this article\nprovides that opposition is to be made to the marriage celebrating officer while the\nEnglish version limits it to the officer of civil status. Following the English version will\nhave its own dangers. First, it makes reference only to civil marriages because it makes\nonly the officer of civil status the competent organ to receive complaints (oppositions). This means, if the marriage is either religious or customary marriage, there is no organ\nempowered to entertain the opposition, as the officer of civil status is not empowered to\ncelebrate these marriages. Secondly, one of the rules of interpretation of laws as\nenshrined under article 2/4 of proclamation 3/95 (Federal Negarit Gazeta establishment\nProclamation) states that in cases of discrepancy between the Amharic and English\nversion of the negarit gazeta, the Amharic version prevails. Hence, for these two reasons\nwe have to follow the Amharic version of the code. Accordingly, opposition is to be made to the organ which has the power to celebrate the\nmarriage. If the marriage to be celebrated is a civil marriage, opposition will be made t\nthe officer of civil status. On the other hand if it is a religious or customary marriage, the\nopposition has to be made to either to religious fathers or to the elderly people celebrating\nthe marriage, depending on the situation.74\nIn order to show the seriousness of the case, the opposition is required to be made in a\nwritten form. Hence, there is no oral opposition to marriage. There is also a time limit\nattached. The opposition has to be made 15 days before the celebration of marriage. In\ncivil marriages, there may not be that much of a problem in the time limit at least as far as\nthe law is concerned. Article 23 of the RFC requires the future spouses to notify the\nofficer of civil status of their intention to conclude marriage, a month before its\ncelebration, and the latter has the obligation to publicize the same. The idea here is\neveryone will have access to the notification publicized by the officer of civil status and\n74 Mehari, 35\nhence within two weeks those interested persons will make opposition.

However, when it comes to the other\nmodes of conclusion of marriage, this kind of stipulation is not provided, making\nobservance of article 19 somehow impractical.

The person to whom opposition is made has to make its decision\nwithin five days.75 If the celebrating officer rejects the opposition and decides to continue\nthe celebration of the marriage, the decision will be final one. However, if the decision is\nto accept the opposition and suspended the celebration of the marriage, the future spouses\nor one of them may appeal to the court against the decision. 76\nThis article shows the\nweight given to the right of the future spouses to form family. 2.6 Effects of Violation of Essential Conditions of Marriage\nThe law has provided for certain conditions which need to be fulfilled for the conclusion\nof a valid marriage. In addition to stipulating conditions, it also provides the chance for\ncertain group of persons to oppose and therefore prevent the conclusion of marriage\nwhich does not fulfill the necessary conditions. However, what would happen to a\nmarriage which was celebrated when one of the conditions is absent? In the forgoing\ndiscussions an attempt will be made to answer this question. Before looking into the consequences of violation of each and every conditions, we have\nto first identify the difference between void and voidable marriages and if such a\ndistinction exists under Ethiopian law. 77\nKatherine O’Donovan had to say the following on this issue\n:-\n75 Article 20/1 RFC \n76 Article 21/1 RFC \n77 Katherine O’Donovan, 1972, Void and voidable marriage in Ethiopian law, JEL vol. VII, No. 2, \n439-441. It should be noted here that though the comments made by the author of the article \nmakes reference to the Civil Code of 1960, they still hold water. The term void and ‘voidable’ are found in the common law system. They have\ntheir counterparts in the laws of continental European countries. In both legal\nsystems he terms used lack a clearly defined meaning and the transposition of a\nterm from one system to another is virtually impossible, in the Amharic version\nof the civil code there is no exact term to convey the concept ‘void’ or\n‘voidable’. Nevertheless these terms will be used since they are the most apt\nterms available for elucidating the law. A void act is an empty act. It does not achieve what it sets out to do so. It does\nnot achieve its intended legal consequences. “ quod nullum est, nullum producit\neffectum.”",

    "text": "An act is void due to a defect therein which is so fundamental as to\ndeprive the act of its very existence. ‘ A defect may make a juristic act either void\nor voidable. If the defect is such that the act is devoid of the legal results\ncontemplated, then the act is said to be void.” The conventional wisdom\nconcerning the void act is that it has no legal effect, but this is not strictly so as\nthe act may have effects unforeseen by the actor, such as those of criminal\nprosecution, because of the illegality of the act. The point about the void act is\nthat it achieves no part of its intended legal consequences and in so far as these\nare concerned it has no effect and can be ignored. A voidable act is an act which, although it contains a defect, has its intended\nlegal effect. The defect in the voidable act is not so serious as to prevent it from\ncoming into effect. “An act that is incapable of taking effect according to its apparent purport\nis said to be void. One which may take effect but is liable to be deprived of\neffect at the option of some or one of the parties is said to be voidable.” The defect contained in the voidable act is sufficiently serious to enable the act\nto be subsequently attacked by one of the parties and declared void by the\ncourts. If, however, it is not avoided the act will take effect as a valid juristic act. One learned writer has suggested that the correct way to view the voidable act\nis as “an act which gives rise to the intend-ed legal consequences, but at the\nsame time gives rise to a counteractive right which may neutralize those\nconsequences in so far as one of the parties is concerned.” A void marriage, if such exists in Ethiopian law, is one to which there is such a\nserious objection in law because of a grave defect that, should its existence be in\nquestion, it will be regarded as never having taken place and can be so treated\nby all affected or interested parties. Any court declaration made would merely\nhave the purpose of affirming that the marriage never existed and of clarifying\nthe status of of the parties as never having been married. Any person having an\ninterest therein could petition for a declaration of non existence of the marriage\nat any time, even after the death of the parties. Since the parties never had the\nstatus of husband and wife none of the normal consequences of marriage would\nfollow. ……",

    "text": "A voidable marriage is quite different from a void marriage. The marriage will\nbe regarded as a valid subsisting marriage unless and until it is attacked. As to\nthe effects of a voidable marriage, a distinction must be drawn between a\nmarriage which, although voidable, is never attacked and therefore never\navoided, and a marriage which is avoided. In the former case the marriage will\nbe valid and all the normal legal consequences of marriage will follow. In the\nlatter case, a further distinction must be made between those marriages which\nare given effect up to the day of avoidance. It is here that the use of the word\n“voidable” may be criticized. It fails to distinguish between the act which is not\nvoid ab initio but is declared void retroactively by a court, and the act which is\ndeprived of all future effect by the court but which retains such effect as it has\nhad up to avoidance. Three categories then emerge. The marriage which is void ab initio, that is\nwhich never came into being or had any effect; the marriage which is void\nretroactively, (ex tunc), that is which came into being, would have been valid\nhad it not been found out, but is not deprived of all effect: and the marriage\nwhich is void ex nunc, that is which is deprived of effect for the future but which\nholds good for the past. The only category into which the Ethiopian marriage\nlaw clearly falls is that of void ex nunc. What is the difference between void and voidable marriage? Does this distinction exist in\nthe RFC? What about the regional family codes? As we can see from the above discussion, unlike other legal systems the Ethiopian law\nrecognizes only voidable marriages. A marriage which has been concluded when one or\nmore of the essential conditions are lacking will be invalidated.78\nThat is to say, from the\ndate of invalidation, the marriage will cease to exist, and the consequences of dissolution\nof marriage will follow. However, for the time being that the marriage was intact, it will\nbe considered as a valid marriage. The other very important thing that needs to be noted here is the change made by the\nRFC in respect of provisions dealing with punishment for violation of essential\nconditions. The Civil code, apart from providing for the civil consequences of violating\nessential conditions, also makes reference to the Penal Code for criminal punishment. However, the civil code did not show the exact punishments accompanying. As a result\nmaintaining these provisions was not necessary.",

And\nas for the guardian, the application has to be made within six month after the day on\nwhich the guardian becomes aware of the existence of marriage, and in any case after the\ndisability has ceased. Here we arae dealing with two types of limitations. The first one is\na relative limitation in that it depends on when the guardian becomes aware of the\nexistence of the marriage. The second is an absolute limitation. In all the circumstance,\nunless an application is made within the specified time the marriage will be validated.",

Chapter Three: Effects of Marriage\nIntroduction\nPeople conclude marriage for different reasons. But in many circumstances, it is the need\nto have the support and assistance of others which is considered as the driving force for\nthe conclusion of marriage. The effects of marriage are mainly derived from the purposes\nits conclusion. Generally we can classify the effects into two: personal and pecuniary. The personal effect relates to the obligation of the spouses to support, respect and assist\neach other as well as to cohabit among others. On the other hand, the spouses may\nacquire property either before the conclusion or during the lifetime of the marriage. One\nimportant issue which arises as a result is the ownership of such property. In connection\nwith the ownership of property, it is also essential to see the right of third parties who are\ncreditors of the spouses. In this chapter you will learn the effect of concluding marriage\non the spouses' personal life as well as its effect on the property.

    "text": "In the following sub section, a\ndiscussion will be made on the different effects a marriage may entail between the\ncouples. In discussing about the effects of marriage, one thing that needs to be always taken into\naccount is the fact that all marriages produce the same legal effect, without considering\nthe mode of their celebration.95 As far as the marriage is concluded in compliance with\nthe essential conditions of marriage, which are valid for all modes of conclusion of\nmarriage, the effects of all marriages are identical. This is similar with the French law. As\nPlaniol clearly stated96\nThe effects of marriage are always identical. There is but one French marriage. This was not always the case everywhere. Among the Romans there was the\nmatrimonium injustum for foreigners and Latins, and the contubernium for\nslaves. The latter did not produce the effects of justae nuptiae. Certain\nlegislations (Prussia, old Russia) recognized morganatic marriages, a type of\nlegitimate union, inferior to marriage. They did not give to the wife or to the\nchildren the rights they would have had as a result of a veritible marriage,\nparticularly as regards equality of rank with her husband or their father. In addition to considering all marriages as having the same legal effect, the law also\navoided the requirement of consummation as a condition for the marriage to have legal\n97\nHence, a marriage, once celebrated will have an effect without having regard to\neffect. the fact of consummation of the marriage. What do you understand by the phrase ‘contract of marriage’? As mentioned earlier, marriage engenders special obligations between husband and wife\nwhich are the result of their status as spouses. However, in many legal systems the parties\n95 Article 40 of RFC \n96 Macel Planiol, 513 \n97 Article 41 of the RFC\nthemselves were given some degree of freedom to determine the effect their marriage\nwill produce through the conclusion of a premarital agreement. A premarital agreement, also referred to as an ante-nuptial or pre-nuptial agreement, is a\ncontract entered into by a man and woman before they marry. The agreement usually\ndescribes what each party’s rights will be if they divorce or if one of them dies.98 There\nare different reasons for drawing a pre-nuptial agreement. ‘ Premarital agreements help\nclarify the parties’ expectations and rights for the future. The agreements may avoid\nuncertainties and fears about how a divorce court might divide property if the marriage\nfails.",

    "text": "’99\nA prenuptial agreement will be enforceable by the court as far as it has fulfilled the\nrequirements stipulated by the law. In some developed countries some voiced their\nconcern on the effect of enforcing the premarital agreement on the rate of divorce. The\nassumption being, the enforcement of prenuptial agreements will lead to more divorce. However, recent developments show otherwise. The increasingly routine enforcement of premarital agreements is another clear\nrepresentation of a changed attitude toward private ordering of the terms of\nmarriage and divorce. At one time, courts declined to enforce premarital\nagreements on the grounds that such arrangements encouraged parties to\ndivorce. Even today, many courts intervene when premarital contracts that are\nfairly executed ex ante lead to what seems to be inequitable results ex post.'' In\ngeneral, however, the formerly hostile judicial response has been replaced by a\npresumption of enforceability…. The move toward private ordering of marital\nrelationships represents a major shift in the law's stance toward intimate\nrelations, a shift that has been correlated empirically with an increased\n100\nincidence of divorce. Under Ethiopian law as well the freedom of the parties has been recognized by allowing\nthem to sign contract of marriage before or on the date of their marriage.

On the other hand, as per article 42/1 of the RFC, a\ncontract of marriage is a contract which is signed by the spouses before or on the date of\ntheir marriage for the purpose of regulating their personal relations and the pecuniary\neffect of their marriage. Though the spouses are given the freedom to regulate the personal and pecuniary effect\nof their marriage, this freedom is not without limitation. As per article 42/3 of the RFC,\nthe parties are not allowed to derogate from the mandatory provisions of the law. Moreover, the parties may not also impose an obligation on third parties.101\nThe contract\nof marriage is signed by the parties to regulate their relationship, and not the relationship\nbetween the spouses with third parties. Hence, this limitation was imposed in the law. 102\nThe Civil Code on Obligations provides four elements for the formation of a contract. The first requirement is that of capacity.",

However, when it comes to judicially interdicted persons, article 15\nof the RFC allows a JIP to conclude marriage after securing authorization from the court. Then the next point will be what will be the effect if the JIP wants to sign a contract of\nmarriage as well? Article 43 of the RFC provides an answer for this. The contract of marriage has to be\nentered into by the JIP himself or herself and that it also has to get the approval of the\ncourt. Unless it fulfills this condition, the contract will not be valid. One other requirement provided by the Civil Code under article 1678 is that of form. In\nprinciple, parties are free to choose any form at the time of contracting. However, if the\nlaw provides for a special form, that special form has to be observed by the contracting\nparties. When we come to contract of marriage, article 44 of the RFC stipulates a special\nform to be observed by the parties. The contract of marriage has to be made in a written\nform and needs to be attested by four witnesses, two from each side. A contract of\nmarriage is somehow peculiar than the other contracts owing to the nature of relationship\n101 Article 46/1 \n102 Look in to article 1678 of the Civil Code for further information. existing between the contracting parties. As a result of the special nature of the\nrelationship which exists between the spouses, it is hard to accept that there will be the\nfree consent and willingness of the parties to sign the marriage contract. That is why the\nlaw requires the attestation of four witnesses who are also required to represent the\nhusband and the wife. Apart from the requirement of attestation, the contract also has to\nbe deposited with the court or the office of civil status.103\nOne question which can be\nraised in relation to this last requirement is what will be the effect of not depositing the\ncontract? Does it mean the contract will lose its validity? There are two views reflected in respect of this issue. The first one tends to favor the\nassertion that the contract of marriage, unless deposited with the office of civil status or\nthe court, will lose its validity.

    "text": "The second line\nof argument is based on the rationale for the requirement of deposit. The reason for\nrequiring the deposit of the contract is to make it available for third parties so that they\nwill take precautions. Hence, the failure to deposit the document should not make the\ndocument to lose its validity; rather it will not have effect on third parties. After looking into the rationale for depositing the contract and the fact that article 45 does\nnot attach any consequence for the failure, one tends to favor the second line of\nargument, especially when we compare article 45 with that of article 44. If the form\nrequirement is not fulfilled, the law provides that the contract will not be valid, whereas\nthis kind of stipulation is not present for article 45. If, the legislature planned to require\ndeposit of the contract at the pain of losing its validity, it would state that, in the same\n105\nmanner as it did under article 44. The contract of marriage, if valid under the law, will govern the pecuniary effects as well\nas the personal relationship of the spouses. However, if the parties did not conclude a\ncontract of marriage, or if the contract is not valid, the law intervenes and regulates their\nrelationship. In the next section, the discussion will be on the personal and pecuniary\neffects of marriage as regulated by the law. 103 Article 45 of RFC \n104 Mehari, 51-52 \n105 Mehari, 52\n3.2 Personal effects of Marriage\nMarriage produces special obligations between the husband and the wife as a result of\ntheir status as spouses. Under the 1960 Civil Code, some of the obligations were common\nto both spouses while some were peculiar to the husband (the duty to give protection to\nthe wife-article 644) and some special to the wife (the duty of obedience-article 635/2). The 1995 FDRE Constitution guaranteed the equality of both spouses at the time of\nentering into and during marriage. These provisions of the Civil Code are contrary to the\nConstitution. As a result, these conditions are abandoned under the new RFC. What we\nhave under the RFC is obligations which are common to both spouses. 3.2.1 Respect, Support and Assistance\nBoth spouses owe respect, support and assistance to each other106. It is the first of all\nduties and it acts as the foundation as the object of marriage is the establishment of\nfamily which requires the assistance and respect of each other.",

Under\nthat article the husband and wife are obliged to observe mutual love, respect, and render\nmutual help and support. In some countries, the spouses are even required to take an oath\nbefore witness (the audience) saying that they will respect, honor, love, support and assist\nthe other partner until death.107\nThe duty to respect, support and assist each other is a\nfundamental duty on both spouses which serves as the foundation of the family. The duty\nis always to be observed irrespective of the health of the spouse. 3.2.2 Family Management\nThe other personal effect of marriage is related to the management of family and care of\nthe children. The Constitution under article 34/1 recognizes the equal right of the spouses\nat the time of entering into, during marriage and at the time of divorce. By virtue of this\narticle both spouses will have equal right in all aspects, including the management of the\n106 Article 49 RFC \n107 Mehari, 55\nfamily. In line with this assertion of the Constitution, article 50 of the RFC reflects the\nequal right of both spouses in te management of the family. Moreover, the spouses are\nrequired to cooperate in protecting the security and interest of the family. Guiding children to be responsible citizens of the society is one of the obligations of the\nparents towards their children. In this respect, article 50/2 of the RFC requires both\nspouses to cooperate in the bringing up and ensuring the good behavior and education of\nthe children. Since the parents are the joint custodians of their children, the responsibility\nin relation to the education, health and behavior o the children is to be shared jointly. However, if one of the spouses is under disability, absent or abandons the family, or is\naway, the responsibility to manage the family rests upon the other spouse. Hence, if, for\ninstance, one of the spouses is away from home for education or work, the responsibility\nof managing the family and bringing up the children rests upon the spouse who stayed at\nhome. One thing which will be point of discussion in relation to family management is the case\nof children from previous marriage. In this regard, article 52 RFC provides the exclusive\nright of each parent to make decision in matters concerning the upbringing of children\nwhom that parent had before the marriage. 3.2.3 Cohabitation\nThe other fundamental obligation of the spouses is the duty to cohabit.108 One of the\npurposes of formation of marriage is to establish life in common.",

As a\nresult of this obligation, one cannot talk of marital rape under the Ethiopian law. 108 Article 53 RFC \n109 Planiol, 514 \n110 Planiol, 514-515\nOne important outcome of this obligation is the determination of residence of the\nspouses. Who will determine the common residence of the spouses? In earlier times, the Civil Code gives the right of determining the common residence to\nthe husband.111\nIt is only when the residence is established in a manner manifestly\nabusive or contrary to the contract of marriage that the wife may voice her concern to the\nfamily arbitrators. This provision obviously is against the constitutional right of the wife\nwhich guarantees the equality of both spouses at the time of entering marriage, during\nmarriage and at the time of divorce. As a result, the RFC under article 54 gave both\nspouses equal say on determining the common residence. Hence, currently both the\nhusband and wife have equal right on determining their common abode. What if the\nspouses could not reach to agreement? The Family Code of the Philippines also entails the same obligation on the spouses. Article 69 of the code gave both spouses the right to fix the family domicile. If, however,\nthere is disagreement, the court may intervene and make the decision for them. When we\ncome to the RFC, it does not particularly address this issue. However, if the spouses have\ndifferences on this matter, it can be referred to family arbitrators as it can be considered\n112\nas dispute arising out of marriage. However, if the parties request to dissolve the\nmarriage on the ground of their disagreement, the petition is to be given to the court, and\nnot to the arbitrators.

In this respect article 56 of the RFC stipulates that both the husband and wife\nowe fidelity to each other. ‘ The duty of fidelity is not a duty of mere morality; rather it is\nsanctioned by positive law. ’114\nArticle 652 of the Criminal Code makes adultery a crime\npunishable upon complaint. In earlier times in some foreign countries several differences\nwere noted in the repression of adultery, depending on whether it is committed by the\nhusband or the wife. In many instances the wife will be subjected to a stricter and\nrigorous punishment as compared to the husband. The reason given for such\ndiscrimination is that:\nThe adultery of a wife can have much more dangerous moral and physical\nconsequences than that of the husband. When a husband has a mistress the\nchildren born of her do not enter the family. They remain strangers to his family. When the wife has a lover, if she has children, they will be the legitimate\nchildren of her husband. He may bring a suit in disavowal, but the proof\nnecessary to drive out of the family the children who are not his, may often fail\n115\nhim…. 3.3 Pecuniary Effects of Marriage\nMarriage also affects the pecuniary relationship of the spouses. In discussing the\npecuniary relationship of spouses, one major question which needs to be answered is\n‘who owns the family property?’ There are several reasons as to why it is important to\nknow who owns a particular piece of property in the marriage, some of which\n116\nincludes\n:-\ni. \nIf someone becomes bankrupt then all of their property falls into the\nhands of the trustee in bankruptcy.

    "text": "Particularly when a house is to be sold, it is necessary\nto know who the owner of the house is so that he or she can sign the\nappropriate paperwork. There have been cases where husbands have\nsold the family home behind their wives’ backs. In such cases it is\nimportant to know whether the wife had an interest in the property and,\nif so, whether the purchase is bound by her interest. iii. On the death of a family member it is important to know who owns what. So, if a wife left all her books to her brother in her will, it would be\nimportant to know which books were hers and which books belonged to\nher husband. iv. Ownership of family property has important symbolic power. At one time\nthe husband owned all of his wife’s property. This reflected the fact that\nhe was regarded as in control of all the family’s affairs. It is arguable\nthat if the law were to state that family property is jointly owned, this\nwould reflect a principle of equality between spouses in marriage. For the above listed and other reasons, it is necessary to determine as to who the owner of\na particular property is. As mentioned earlier, contract of marriages play a great role in\ndetermining such issues. However, the spouses may not draw a contract or the contract\ndrawn may not be valid for different reasons. In such situations, the law will intervene. In\nthis respect, the law should seek to track three aims. ‘ First, the law should produce as\nhigh a degree of certainty as possible. Secondly, the law should reflect the wishes and\nexpectations of most couples. Thirdly, the law should be practical and easy to apply. ’117\nIn the following subsection, a discussion will be made as to how the RFC governs the\npecuniary relations of spouses. 117 Jonathan Herring, 118\n3.3.1 Personal property\nMarriage results in the unification of the spouses and not their property. As a result, the\nlaw recognizes the existence of personal property in marriage. Hence, the property which\nthe spouses possess on the day of their marriage, or which they acquire after marriage by\nsuccession of donation, will remain their personal property.118\nIn addition, if the spouses\nget property through either succession or donation, then that property will remainto be the\npersonal property of the successor or donee. In theory marriage is an institution which the spouses enter into for life long.",

    "text": "The\nassumption is that the parties will remain married for several years to come. In such\nsituations, there will be a probability of mixture of personal with common property. For\ninstance, the husband may need to sell the car which he succeeded from his late father\nand buy a new one. Would the new car remainto be his personal property or would it\nchange to common property? In principle properties acquired by onerous title after marriage through the exchange of\n119\npersonal property will remainto be personal property of the spouses. However, for this\nprinciple to work, the party claiming to retain the personal property has to apply for the\ndeclaration of the court of such facts. Failure to get the declaration has the effect of\nmaking the property common property. In the hypothetical case mentioned above, unless\nthe husband seeks the approval of the court, the newly acquired car will be common\nproperty of the spouses. One important thing that can be understood from the above discussions is that the mere\nfact of conclusion of marriage will not create common property regime. There is the\npossibility of retaining and having personal property. Then which property will be\nconsidered as the common property of the spouses? In the next section, this question will\nbe answered. 118 Article 57 RFC \n119 Article 58 RFC\n3.3.2 Common Property of Spouses\nThe notion of community of property interest between the husband and wife has\nhad a long and interesting history. Traces of this idea are found in Babylonian\nlegislation over 4,000 years ago, as well as in ancient Egypt and more modern\nGreece. There is no evidence, however, of any connection between these ancient\nvestiges and the system as we know it. Neither shall we find its beginnings in the\nRoman law. The origin of the system seems rather to lie in the customs of certain\nGermanic tribes. The migration of these tribes throughput Western Europe were\nvery extensive and resulted in widespread diffusion of the community idea. Thus,\nthe Franks introduced it into northern France and the Goths into Spain where\ndistinct evidences of the community appear in the second Visigothic code in the\n7th century.120\nThe concept of common property of spouses is also incorporated under the 19960 Civil\nCode well as the RFC. The first category of property which is considered as common\nproperty is the income of the spouses. The sources of the income can be three: personal\nefforts of the spouses, meaning the income acquired through employment, income\nderived from the common property, or thirdly, income derived from personal property.",

The relevant part of the article is reproduced here122\n:-\nThere is a split between judges as to whether the retirement pension is a\ncommon marital property or not. The federal first instance court, in Civil File\nno 3361 ruled that a retirement pension is the personal right of the one who is\nemployed in the public service and rejected the claim of a wife to be awarded\npart of the pension, in file no 767/93, the same court reached the same\nconclusion, arguing that the source of the pension was the respondent’s\nemployment in the public service. The employment existed before the petitioner\nand the respondent concluded marriage. As such, the court rejected the\npetitioner’s claim to part of the retirement pension attributable to the\ncontributions made by the ex-spouse during the 14 years of their marriage…. Retirement plans differ depending on who pays for the plan and how benefits\nare determined. One is a pension plan system where both the employee and the\nemployer contribute to the pension fund. The other is a system where only the\nemployer deposits to the pension fund. Ethiopia does not have the latter kind of\npension plan.",

    "text": "The public servant's proclamation No. 345/2003 requires both the\npublic servant and the employer to contribute to the Civil Service Fund. In some jurisdictions that have contributory plans, the employee is entitled to\nreceive what he has contributed even if he quits participating in the plan by\nterminating his relation with the employer. So, what the employee contributes in\nsuch pension plans vests immediately. However, the employee's interest in the amount attributable to the employer's\ncontributions may not vest until the employee has worked for a definite period of\ntime. 122 Wondwessen Demissie, Implementation Problems of the Revised Family Code, Berchi issue \nno. 7\nOne has to note the difference between vested pension rights and matured\npension rights. When a pension benefit is vested but not matures, an employee is\nabsolutely entitled to benefits, though he is not entitled to actual payments until\nfuture date. According to Ethiopian pension law, neither the employee's not the\nemployer's contribution is vested before the employee has provided service for\ncertain period of time in the public office. Under article 21/3 of the Public Servant's Pension proclamation, a public\nservant who leaves his work before completing ten years is not entitled to what\nhe contributed. His contribution is vested and hence can be collected if he\nresigns after working for 10 years or more. As regards the contribution made by\nthe employer, contributions are said to be vested if the employee is entitled to a\nretirement pension for life…. Generally the amount to be deposited to the Civil Service Fund, from which\nretirement pensions are paid, is ten percent of the salary of he public servant. The public servant contributes four percent, and the remaining six percent is\ncontributed by the employer. In so far as the employee contribution is made during the marriage, there is no\ndoubt that the four percent contributed each month is a marital property. This is\nbecause the contributed money is part of the salary, which is common property\nof spouses. The employer's contribution is also a marital property to the extent it\nwas made during the marriage and that such contributions made because the\nemployee spouse was providing service to the public. Though not salary, the\ncontribution made by the employer is an employment-related benefit that should\nbe treated as common property lie salary, which is perhaps the primary\nemployment-related benefit. Therefore, as ling as they are made during the\nmarriage, it is the contribution made by both the public servant and the\nemployer which should be treated as marital property.",

This will have a\nnegative impact on the right of the other spouse. Various disputes resulted from this\nduring the time when the 1960 Civil Code was applicable, and the views of the courts\nwere diverse. In order to rectify this, the RFC provides a qualification for the\npresumption. Hence, the legal presumption would still be applicable even if the property\nis registered in the name of only one spouse. In this connection a question may be asked as to the fate of a house whose construction\nwas finalized after the conclusion of marriage, but the land on which to construct the\nhouse was obtained prior to marriage by one of the spouses. Would this be considered a\npersonal or common property? In the case between heirs of w/ro Amelework Gelete vs. Ato Bishaw Ashame et al125\n., the\nFederal first instance court after establishing the fact that the house in dispute was\ncommon property, proceeded in stating that the land on which the house was built belong\nto the deceased. Then the court gave an order for the separate estimation of the price of\nthe land and the house and decided that only the proceeds from the sale of the house is\nsubject to partition. As such, the claimant (now respondents) would be required to pay\nonly half of the estimated price of the house without considering the price of the land on\nwhich the house was built. The case was brought to the Cassation division of the Federal\nSupreme court. The court in its reasoning stated that private ownership of urban land has\nbeen abolished by virtue of Proclamation 47/67, and land is the property of the state. 125 Cassation File no 19479\nHence, there cannot be separate estimation of the price of the house and the land. With\nthis reasoning the court repealed the decisions of the lower courts. In another case, between Ato Mekonen belachew vs. w/ro Alemitu Adem,126\nthe\nconstruction of the house in dispute began few months before the conclusion of the\nmarriage. The respondent obtained the land as a result of being a member of a\ncooperative society and she also took loan for construction.

The Cassation court on the other hand held that since\nthe house got its current structure as a house, and since the loan was paid from the\nincome of the spouses, which itself is a common property, after the conclusion of the\nmarriage, the house is the common property of the spouses. Hence, as per the decision,\nwhat matters is not the time in which the land was acquired, rather whether there was\nsharing of burden in the construction of the house. 3.3.3 Management of Personal and Common Property of Spouses\nThe other important issue which needs to be discussed in relation to personal and\ncommon property is the management of such property. Who has the power to administer\nand manage the personal property of the spouse? What about the common property? This\nsection addresses these questions. As the law clearly stipulates under article 59, each spouse is to administer his respective\npersonal property. However, through the contract of marriage, administration of the\nproperty may be entrusted on the other spouse. Moreover, there is also the possibility of\nassigning the other spouse through the contract of agency.127\nOne question which needs\nto be raised here is whether the contract of agency concluded between the spouses require\nthe approval of the court as per the requirement under article 73 of the code. This article\nrequires contracts entered into between spouses during marriage to be approved by the\n126 Cassation file no 25005 \n127 Article 61 RFC\ncourt on pain of invalidation. The assumption under article 73 is that considering the\nspecial nature of the relationship existing between the two spouses, they may not freely\nconsent to the contract.

As far as the management of income of the spouses is concerned, each spouse is given\n129\nthe mandate to receive his earnings. This power of the spouses to receive their\nrespective income can be transferred for the other spouse. However, in such situations the\nreceiving spouse has the obligation to give account. The law also recognizes the\npossibility of having joint bank account in which the spouses may deposit the income. In respect of other common property, article 35/7 of the constitution recognizes the fact\nthat women have equal rights with men with respect to the administration of property. This includes the right to administer the marital property. In line with this provision of\nthe constitution, the RFC stipulates that the common property is to be administered\njointly by the spouses. However, in cases where one of the spouses is declared incapable\nor for any of the other reasons stated under article 66/2, the other spouse alone will\nadminister the common property. The spouse who administers the common property\nalone is duty bound to inform the other spouse about the administration. 128 Mehari, 66-67 \n129 Article 64/1 RFC\nOne issue which can be raised in respect of common proeprty is the freedom of the\nspouses to dispose of the common property.

In one of the cases130\n,\nthe husband sold a car which is common property. However, due to his refusal to perform\nthe contract, the buyer brought an action in the court. The wife also joined the case as an\nopposition claimant, saying that the sale contract was entered into without her knowledge\nand requested for the invalidation of the contract.

Moreover, borrowing or lending money exceeding five hundred \nEthiopian birr or standing surety for such amount also requires the permission of the other \nspouse. For further information, see article 68 of the RFC\nparticular contract who may request invalidation. The case of contracts entered into in\nviolation of the above mentioned stipulations of the RFC are somehow peculiar in the\nsense the invalidation is being requested by a spouse who was not party of the contract. This obviously is not what is envisaged in article 1808 of the Civil Code. Article 69 of\nthe RFC by way of exception, allows the spouse without whose consent the contract was\nentered to request for the revocation (invalidation) of the contract.",

    "text": "Hence, it can be\nconcluded that this provision of the RFC provides for an additional ground for\ninvalidation of a contract.133 However, it should also be noted that the right of the spouse\nto request for invalidation has a period of limitation. The application has to be made\nwithin six months in which the other spouse came to know the existence of the contract\nor in other cases within two years after the obligation has been entered.134\nBy providing\nthe opportunity to apply for invalidation on the one hand and limiting the time framework\nin which the application may be made, on the other, the law has tried to strike a\ncompromise on the two competing interests of the spouse and the security of transaction. 3.3.4 Debts of Spouses\nIn their day to day life, the spouses may incur different debts either personally or for the\nbenefit of the family. The right of third parties on the property of the spouses as a means\nof payment for the debt varies with the type of debt incurred. Generally, debts of spouses\nmay be classified either as personal debt or debt incurred in the interest of the household. If the debt is a personal debt incurred by one of the spouses, third parties will first\nproceed on the personal property of the indebted spouse. However, if the indebted spouse\ndoes not have personal property, the debt will be recovered from the common property of\nthe spouses.135 The reason for allowing recovery of personal debt from common property\nseems to be the need to give creditors wider right.136\nHowever, in this circumstance the\nright of the other spouse should also be considered. In this respect, Ato Mehari had the\nfollowing to say\n133 Mehari, 78 \n134 Article 69/2 RFC \n135 Article 70/1 RFC \n136 Mehari, 81\nበእርግጥ የግል እዳ ከጋራ ሃብት ከተከፈለ በ`ላ ጋብቻው በፍቺ ከፈረሰ\nበንብረት ክፍፍሉ ጊዜ ይህንን ግምት ውስጥ በማስገባት ከጋረ ሃብቱ ለእዳው\nየተከፈለውን መጠን የሌላውን ወገን ድርš ከባለእዳው ድርš በካሳ መልክ\nእንዲከፈለው የመጠየቅ መብት ማመቻቸት ይገባ ይሆናል፡፡ይህም በተššለው ህግ\nአንቀጽ 87 በተመለከተው ስር ይወድቅ ይሆናል የሚል እምነት አለ፡፡\nOn the other hand, debts incurred in the interest of the household are considered as joint\nand several debts and will primarily be recovered from the common property of the\nspouses. 137\nHere, if the common property is not enough to cover the debt, the creditor\nmay proceed to the personal property of either of the spouses. Since the spouses have the\nobligation to support each other and contribute to the household during their marriage,\ndebts incurred for the household are made recoverable even from the personal property of\neither of the spouses.",

Compare article 604/3 of the Civil Code and article 28/2 as well as article 42\nRFC and 625 of the Civil Code\n2. Discuss the personal effects of marriage. 3. What is the difference between personal and common property? Can a spouse obtain\npersonal property while in the marital union? 137 Debts incurred in the interest of the household include debts incurred to fulfill the livelihood of \nthe spouses and their children, debts incurred in order to fulfill an obligation of maintenance to \nwhich both he spouses or one of them is bound and other debts which are acknowledged to be \nsuch by the court at the request of either of the spouses o the creditor. See article 71 of the RFC\nChapter Four:  Proof of Marriage\nIntroduction\nFamily is the basic component of any society. Marriage is one of the means in which this\nbasic element of the society may be established. Through the institution of marriage, the\nfamily which is the fundamental unit of the society is founded. As a result, marriage\nentails its own consequences and the spouses who are joined by marital bond assume\ndifferent obligations towards each other. As a result, any person who can show the\nexistence of marital bond may request the fulfillment of these obligations. One important\nquestion that can be raised in this relation is how does one prove the existence of\nmarriage? As Planiol clearly stipulated, if a person desires to draw a juridical\nconsequence from the existence of a marriage, he must begin by proving its\ncelebration.138\nHowever, there may also be other possible ways of proving the existence\nof marriage. In this chapter you will learn the different available means on the basis of\nwhich one can prove the existence of this institution. Objectives\nAfter completing this chapter, students are expected to:\n analyze international legal instruments to which Ethiopia is a party and domestic\nlegal instrument requiring the registration of marriage.  discuss the need to register marriage.  identify the modes of proof of conclusion of marriage.  distinguish the difference between proving marriage by certificate of marriage and\npossession of status. 138 Planiol, 497\n4.1 Registration of Marriage\nThe Revised Family Code declares mandatorily that marriage shall be registered by a\ncompetent officer of civil status. Such registration is to be conducted irrespective of the\nform of celebration of marriage.139 The officer of civil status who has celebrated the\nmarriage has also the obligation to issue a certificate of marriage to the spouses.",

    "text": "This\nrequirement of the RFC is in line with the country’s international commitment. Article 3\nof the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration\nof Marriages, to which Ethiopia is a party, mandates the registration of marriage in an\nappropriate official register by the competent authority. In addition to this, one of the\nprinciples which need to be given effect to by taking necessary legislative or other\nmeasures by virtue of article 1 of the Recommendation on consent to marriage, minimum\nage of marriage and registration of marriage is registration of marriages.140\nWhen we come to the particulars of the record of marriage, article 30 of the RFC requires\nthe record to show the full names, dates and places of birth, of each of the spouses and\ntheir witnesses including their addresses. This indicates that some of the purposes of\nissuing the certificate are to control the fulfillment of essential conditions of marriage, to\nprotect the family institution and for evidentiary purpose. One thing that should be noted\nhere is the fact that the effects of marriage begins at the time of conclusion of marriage\nand not at the time of issuance of marriage certificate. The law accommodates a situation\nin which the certificate might be issued at a latter time. In such circumstances, the effect\nof marriage dates back to the conclusion of marriage and not to the date of issuance of the\ncertificate. In relation to the requirement of registration of marriage, article 321 stipulates for the\nestablishment of necessary institutions in areas where the code has application, within six\nmonths from the coming into force of the code. However, this institution is not yet\n139 Article 29/1 RFC \n140 See article 1 of the UN Recommendation on Consent to Marriage, Minimum age of Marriage \nand Registration of marriages, General Assembly resolution 2018 (XX)\nestablished.141\nHowever, until the establishment of the Office of Civil Status, article\n321/2 gives the mandate for appropriate authorities of the administration to issue\ncertificate of marriage. 4.2 Proof of Marriage by Certificate of Marriage\nThe law considers certificate of marriage as the primary means of proving marriage. As\nindicated in the preceding section, the officer of civil status has to register all marriages\neither at the time of celebration or even after the celebration. The obligation of the officer\ngoes to the extent to register marriage of his own motion whenever he becomes aware of\n142\nthe marriage. One way or another, the certificate issued by the officer serves as a\nprimary means of proving the celebration of marriage.",

    "text": "The documentary evidence can be relied on by parties who wish to benefit from the\neffects of marriage. That is to say, the availability of the evidence is not limited to the\nspouses only. As Planiol puts it\n‘The rule is general, in the sense that it is applicable to all persons. It is not\nrestricted to the spouses. It applies to third parties and particularly to the\nchildren of the marriage….The law maker imposes the burden of producing an\nact of civil status upon any person who sets up in his own behalf a civil effect of\nmarriage…. The law is also general in that it excludes all means of proof other\nthan the act of civil status. No kind of written instrument can take its place. As a\nmatter of fact there is no other kind of written instrument whose purport id to\nattest the fact of celebration of marriage. Neither the publication nor the\ncontract of marriage proves that the intended marriage has taken place. A\n143\nfortiori, oral proof is not admissible.’ Hence, the certificate of marriage can be relied upon by those persons who seek to get\nsome benefit from the conclusion of marriage. This includes the spouses themselves as\nwell as the children. The certificate of marriage proves the fact of celebration of\n141 ፊሊዾስ አይናለም፣ (1997አ. ም)፤ ጋብቻ ስለመፈጸሙ በትዳር ሁኔታ ስለማረጋገጥ፡ ህጉና አተገባበሩ፤ህጋዊነት፤ቅጽ \n3 ቁጥር 1, ገጽ 36 \n142 Article 29 RFC \n143 Planiol, 498\nmarriage. That is why other documents like the contract of marriage are excluded. However, this is treated somehow differently under the Revised Oromiya Family Code. Under this code, marriage certificate serves as primary means of proving marriage. However, article 93/1 of the code allows proving conclusion of marriage by adducing any\ncredible evidence. As discussed above, civil marriages will be registered at the time of celebration whereas\nthe registration or religious and customary marriages is to be performed after their\ncelebration either upon the application of the spouses or upon the officer’s own motion. ‘However, due to the fact that there is no specific law on registration coupled with lack of\nawareness among the society, it is hard to say that the registration of religious and\ncustomary marriages has been undertaken. ’144\nThis will have a negative impact on the\njudicial system as far as proof of existence of marriage is concerned. 4.3 Proof of Marriage by Possession of Status\nWhat does possession of status mean?

    "text": "There are also some exceptional circumstances in which the marriage\ncertificate duly drawn may be lost or destroyed. In such circumstances, the law, by way\nof exception, allows proving marriage by possession of status. Planiol defines possession of status as the fact that a man and a woman who live together\nare deemed to be married by those who know them.145\nMore or less the same definition is\ngiven under article 96 of the RFC. This article states ‘A man and a woman are deemed to\nhave the possession of status of spouses when they mutually consider themselves and live\nas spouses and when they are considered and treated as such by their family and the\ncommunity.’ So, in proving the existence of marriage through the possession of status,\nthe opinions of the spouses themselves, their family and the community is pertinent. The\nmajor question which needs to be considered here is as to what is to be proved. Should\n144 ፊሊዾስ አይናለም፣ (1997አ. ም)፤ ጋብቻ ስለመፈጸሙ በትዳር ሁኔታ ስለማረጋገጥ፡ ህጉና አተገባበሩ፤ህጋዊነት፤ቅጽ \n3 ቁጥር 1, ገጽ, 40 \n145 Planiol,\nthere be a strict interpretation of article 96 and not bother about the celebration of\nmarriage? Or should the possession of status prove that the alleged marriage was\ncelebrated in one of the three forms provided under the RFC? In relation to this, we may find two views. ‘The first view advocates for a strict interpretation of the definition provision of article\n96 and argues against the requirement of proving the celebration of marriage. According\nto this view, if one who alleges the existence of marriage is allowed to prove it by\npossession of status; he or she needs to prove two facts. The first fact is concerned with\nhow a man and a woman treat each other. The two should consider themselves and live as\nspouses. The second point of concern is how the external community and the families of\nthe alleged spouses view the relationship. Both the community and the family should\nconsider the relationship to be a marriage and treat the two as husband and wife. ’146\nThe view of families and community is to a greater extent influenced by the religion and\n147\n:\nculture followed. On this point, Ato Philipos has the following to say\n‘Family treatment may vary with variation in culture and religion. According to\nthe family law, family relation refers to both consanguinity and affinity\nrelations, and family acceptance is one requirement for proof of marriage by\npossession of status. The law never admits any individual as competent and\nrelevant witness other than the family and community members.",

    "text": "The fact to be\nproved by the family has also limitation. The limitation is the family shall testify\nnot the possession of status or their living together as spouses, but they must\ntestify their acceptance as spouses. Logically, it is believed that the family will\ncommonly accept the parties as spouses because of their participation in\nmarriage ceremony, seeing observable evidences about conclusion of marriage,\nand etc.’ [ translated]\n146 Wondwossen Demissie, (2007), Implementation Problems of the Revised family Code, Berchi \nissue no. 6, page 3 \n147 ፊሊዾስ አይናለም፣ (1997አ. ም)፤ ጋብቻ ስለመፈጸሙ በትዳር ሁኔታ ስለማረጋገጥ፡ ህጉና አተገባበሩ፤ህጋዊነት፤ቅጽ \n3 ቁጥር 1, ገጽ, 45\nThe second view advocates for the need to show “Celebration of marriage”. The\nrequirement under this view is that a person who would like to prove the existence of\nmarriage has to prove that the marriage was celebrated in one of the three forms of\nmarriage provided under the RFC. The main point here is, if the fact of celebration of\nmarriage is not required for proving marriage by possession of status, it will have the\neffect of confusing marriage with irregular union. Moreover, as can be clearly inferred\nfrom the title of the chapter for proof of marriage and its article 95 the fact to be proved\nby possession of status is conclusion of marriage. The basic issue that needs to be proved\nin courts is whether there is conclusion of marriage or not; hence, the basic issue should\nnot be about existence or non-existence of possession of status of spouses.148 This second\nview is also reflected by Ato Mehari. According to him, to prove existence of marriage\nby possession of status, the parties have to show that the marriage was concluded\nfollowing one of the three modes of celebration of marriage.149\nThis second view is also reflected in the Tigray Family Code as well as the Revised\nOromiya Family Code. Article 123/2 of the Tigray Family Code, in respect of who may\nbe witnesses to prove possession of status, requires the witnesses to be those persons who\nwere present at the time of celebration of marriage. This requirement of the law shows\nthat the witnesses are supposed to prove the fact of celebration of marriage. The Revised Oromiya Family Code, on the other hand, under article 93/2 states that if a\nperson can prove that marriage is concluded, the court will take presumption of\nconclusion of marriage. What is required by the law is proving the conclusion of\nmarriage. The law also provides for three ways by which marriage is concluded.",

    "text": "So,\nproving marriage under article 93/2 means proving that the marriage was celebrated by\none of the three modes of conclusion of marriage. The directive which was issued by the Supreme Court in 1981 EC also reflects the same\nposition. Article 3/1 of the directive stipulates that proof by possession of status is used to\nprove the celebration of marriage in one of the three modes of celebration of marriage. 148 Id., 42 \n149 Mehari, 119\nHence, what is expected of the witnesses is to show to the court that the parties treat\nthemselves as spouses, that the family and other persons treat them as married and that\nthey know of the celebration of the marriage at some point in time.150\nWhen we look at the practices of courts, these two different views are reflected in the\ndecisions. In the case between w/ro Abrehet Akele vs. Social Security Authority (SSA),\nthe petitioner W/ro Abrehet prayed the court to rule as to the existence of marriage\nbetween her and the deceased so that she would be lawfully entitled to claim a widow’s\npension allowance from the respondent SSA. As the certificate of marriage was not\navailable, she also requested the court to prove the existence of marriage through\npossession of status. After hearing the witnesses, the court ruled in her favor. The\nrespondent appealed from this decision to the high court saying that since the witnesses\ndid not testify as to the time, place etc of celebration of marriage, it cannot be concluded\nthat there was marriage between the deceased and the claimant. However, this argument\nof the appellant was not accepted by the High Court. The High Court in its reasoning\nstated that in order to establish possession of status of spouses, article 96 of the RFC\nrequires that a man and a woman treat each other as husband and wife, and that they are\ntreated as such by their families and the community. Hence, the witnesses are not\nexpected to testify as to the celebration of marriage\n151\nIn the case between Wro Wagaye vs. Wrt Etsub\nthe claimant brought an action to the\nFFIC asking the court to pronounce her as the wife of the late Shaleka Hailemickael.

However, the ideal is not always realized in practice, and\nmarriages dissolve and disintegrate for different reasons. ‘ The dissolution of marriage is\nthe breaking of the conjugal bond and the cessation of the effect the union of the spouses\nproduce either as regards them or as regards third parties. ’152\nThere are various reasons\nfor the dissolution of marriage. These causes can be classified into two: operation of the\nlaw and act of the parties i.e., divorce. In the next sections, you will learn about the\nvarious grounds for the dissolution of marital union as well as the consequences of\ndissolution.

Grounds of Dissolution\nAs mentioned above, most of the time marriages are concluded to last forever. However, the reality shows us otherwise and many reasons can be enumerated for\n152 Planiol, 625\nthe dissolution of marriages.

    "text": "The first ground for the dissolution of marriage as provided under article 75/a of the RFC\nis the death of one of the spouses, which brings the marital conjugal to an end. Apart\nfrom actual death of one of the spouses, the law also recognizes declaration of absence as\nanother ground for dissolution. ‘ Absence, as a legal institution, is justified by the\nnecessity of dealing with situations where a person cannot be considered as being dead,\nbut where it is likely that such is the case. ’153\nThe manner and condition in which absence\nof a person will be declared is dealt under the Civil Code. One of the effects of\ndeclaration of absence, as stipulated under article 163 of the Code is the dissolution of\nmarriage of the absentee. So, the reading of articles 75 RFC coupled with article 163 of\nthe Civil Code will lead us to conclude that declaration of absence is a cause for\ndissolution of marriage. The other ground for dissolution of marriage is the non fulfillment of the essential\nconditions of marriage. As discussed in chapter two, the law has put in place various\nconditions which need to be fulfilled for the conclusion of a valid marriage. If, however,\nthe marriage is concluded without the observance of one or more of these essential\n154\nconditions, the marriage will be dissolved by the order of the court. Apart from these three causes for dissolution of marriage by operation of the law, the\nactions of the parties could also be a reason for dissolution. In the next section the\ndevelopment of divorce laws in different countries as well as Ethiopia and the different\ntypes of divorce as well as the consequences will be discussed. 153 Catherine O’Donovan, (1969), the Law of physical persons, 125 \n154 Article 75/b RFC\n5.1.2 Divorce\nWhat do you understand by the term divorce? Discuss the development of divorce laws in\nfew selected countries. Divorce has been defined by Planiol as the rupture of a valid marriage during the life of\nthe two spouses.155 Currently, divorce is an extremely common legal ac;, however, this is\nnot always so. Many of the early laws of countries were influenced by the Catholic\nChurch and in many instances divorce was not allowed. For instance, prior to 1857,\ndivorce was not allowed in England for any ground. As Friedman noted:156\n‘England was a “divorceless society,”…until 1857. There was no …judicial\ndivorce. The very wealth might squeeze a bill of divorce out of parliament.",

    "text": "Between 1800 and 1836 there were, on average, three of these a year. For the\nrest, unhappy husbands and wives had to be satisfied with annulment (no easy\nmatter), or divorce from bed and board (a mensa et thoro), a form of legal\nseparation which did not entitle either spouse to marry again…’\nJonathan Herring further elaborated the situation in England back then in the following\n157\nmanner:\nPrior to 1857 the ecclesiastical (church) courts determined the law on divorce. This meant that although nullity decrees could be made, divorce was not\navailable through the courts. The only form of divorce was by an Act of\nParliament. This was a hugely expensive procedure that was only open for a few\npeople. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 was the first Act to create an\nalternative to divorce by Act of the Parliament. The Act created a divorce\n155 Planiol, 630 \n156 Friedman, L.M., A History of American Law, as cited by Ira Mark Ellman, Family Law cases, \ntext, problems, 187 \n157 Herring, 80-81\nprocedure through the courts. However, there was a difference between the\ngrounds available to a husband and to a wife. For example, a husband could\nrely on his wife’s adultery, but a wife could only rely on a husband’s adultery if\nthere were aggravating circumstances (e.g. the adultery was incestuous or there\nwas some ‘unnatural offence’). The Matrimonial causes Act 1923 put the\nhusband and wife in the same position-simple adultery was a ground for divorce\nfor both. The grounds were extended further in the Matrimonial Causes Act\n1937 to include cruelty, desertion or incurable insanity. The last ground was of\nparticular significance because for the first time it recognized that a party could\nbe divorced even though they have not behaved in a blameworthy way.’ The situation that existed in England was also reflected in other countries. The laws of\nmany countries at that time were very restrictive in the sense divorce was available for\nvery few persons. However, the 19th century has witnessed an increase in the demand for\na simpler way of divorce. Consequently, easy divorce laws grew out of the needs of the\nmiddle-class mass.158 However, one should note here that though divorce was relatively\neasier when compared to earlier times, divorce was not fully liberalized. In this\nconnection, Friedman observed the following: 159\n[Divorce] statutes were never simple, facilitative laws.",

    "text": "To begin with, the law\nrecognized no such thing as consensual divorce. It was in form an adversary\nlawsuit: plaintiff had to allege and prove “grounds” for divorce against\ndefendant. In some states, only innocent plaintiffs were allowed to marry again. Guilty parties were left to stew in their juices…..\nThe moral goals of divorce law were reflected in the statutory lists of\n“grounds.” Adultery was always on the list. … Desertion was commonly\nincluded. Other grounds included fraud, impotence, conviction of a felony, or\nhabitual drunkenness. 158 Ira Ellman, 189 \n159 Lawrence M. Friedman, (1984), Rights of Passage: Divorce Law in Historical Perspective, \nOregon Law review, Vol. 63, 653-655\nThe dramatic changes in divorce law in the early nineteenth century lend\nthemselves to a standard kind of economic explanation based on property\ninterests, the demands of a broad-based, active land market, the need for clear\ntitles, and for devolution and disposition of property along rational lines. With change in time, the number of divorce in many countries has increased\nsignificantly. There were also pressures to adopt laws which will make divorce an easy\ntask. In the twentieth century, the discussion changed from consensual divorce to no-fault\ndivorce. ‘ No-fault goes beyond consensual divorce. Either partner can end a marriage\nsimply by asserting that the marriage has broken down. The older laws did not recognize\nconsensual divorce, let alone no-fault divorce. No-fault made divorce cheaper abolished\nthe double standard and closed the gap between reality and appearance. ’160 Currently,\nmany laws have adopted a no-fault divorce. ‘ The no fault divorce has as its major goal a\nreform in the grounds for divorce, supplemented by accompanying changes in the\nfinancial awards thought necessary to prevent considerations of marital misconduct from\nreappearing in another guise. ’161 In many legal systems, there has been much debate over\nwhether there should be fault based or no-fault based divorce system. In that process\nmany arguments were forwarded to defend the no-fault divorce. These arguments\ninclude:162\na) ‘Empty Shell’:- it has been maintained that if only spouse wishes to divorce\nthere is little value in forcing the couple to stay married. There is no point in\nkeeping ‘empty shell’ marriages alive. Making divorce available only on\nproof of fault does not lead to happier marriages, but to parties separating,\nalthough legally married, or to cantankerous divorce. b) The ‘right to divorce’:- some argue that it is now a human right to divorce.",

Friedman, (1984), Rights of Passage: Divorce Law in Historical Perspective, \nOregon Law Review, Vol. 63, 664 \n161 Herman Hill Kay, (1987), Equality and Difference: A Perspective on No-fault Divorce and its \nAftermath, Cincinnati Law Review, vol.56 no. 1, 14 \n162 Jonathan Herring, 101\nc) Bitterness: - a common complaint is that a fault-based system promotes\nbitterness. By focusing on the spouses’ minds on the past and the\nunhappiness of the marriage and making these public it is argued that fault-\nbased systems exacerbate the anger and frustration they feel towards each\nother. d) The impossibility of allocating blame: - the law cannot really determine who\nwas truly to blame for the break-up. There are practical difficulties in\ndiscovering the facts of the case, particularly as the husband and the wife\nare often the only two witnesses. But even if all the facts were known, the\ncourt may still not be in a position to allocate blame.

It has introduced “divorce hindrance devices”\nwhich would discourage parties from seeking divorce.164\nThe aim of the law in\nintroducing these divorce hindrance devices was to protect the family from disintegration. However, whether family unity can be kept by making divorce hard to get was a debated\nissue. Studies conducted at the time of drafting the RFC show that the fault based divorce\n165\nsystem has its own drawbacks. Since the party who is found to be at fault will be\npenalized by deduction from his share of the common property, the spouses would\nengage in fierce and strong debate in the courts.",

One thing that needs to\nbe noted here is that in both types of divorce, an application has to be made to the court. 168\nThat is to say, the power of declaring divorce is given only to the court. 5.1.2.1 Divorce by Mutual Consent\nThe RFC allows parties to seek for divorce by mutual consent. Considering the freedom\nof the parties, the law allows the spouses to petition for divorce by agreement. However,\nit cannot be said that divorce even in cases of mutual consent is automatic. Since the state\nhas the obligation of safeguarding the family, the courts are required to make some\ninterventions. The intervention of the court in mutual consent divorce is limited to\n169\ncounseling the spouses separately to renounce their divorce. If on the other hand, the\nparties are not willing to renounce the divorce, the court may order a cooling period. The divorce by mutual consent is not necessarily a divorce without a cause. The spouses\nmay have, and in many situations, do have causes for separation.",

Betrothal, marriage, divorce and concubinage are susceptible of raising\nnumerous legal difficulties. Chapter IX, which comprises of article [722 to 737]\nrefer to and deal with the manner of solving these difficulties.

On the other hand, they are inspired by the idea that the\njudges who are appointed by the state are not perhaps the best placed and the\nbest qualified to resolve disputes of a family nature: this consideration has led\ndifferent countries, such as Brazil, to create special jurisdiction for family\nlitigation. This trend can correspond to that which has led many countries to\nestablish special jurisdiction for the adjudication of cases, civil or criminal,\nconcerning young persons. Moreover, there are at the moment few qualified\nlawyers in Ethiopia; and for this reason, there is ground to dread the crowding\nof courts, which is the present evil all over the country; this consideration has\nstrengthened, our opinion, which is materialized by the provision of Arts.

    "text": "It is compulsory: the code compels resort to arbitrators whenever there is a\nfamily dispute by making family conflicts out of the jurisdiction of the regular\ncourts except when they come by way of appeal. … The law forces the parties to\nconsent to the arbitration of their dispute by persons selected by them. Thus\nthere is no such thing as arbitral submission or an agreement to arbitrate a\ndispute and to be bound by its result. In family disputes there is no choice but\narbitration, there is no way to go to the courts but through appeal and that only\nin cases of “corruption of the arbitrators or fraud in regard to third persons” or\nin cases of illegality or “ manifest” unreasonableness of the award. 2. It is not before fulltime arbitrators: generally the arbitrators are those\npersons who have been witnesses to the marriage or betrothal though the parties\nor the court or the arbitrators may appoint other persons to act as arbitrators\n3. It is seemingly speedy under certain circumstances: the arbitrators are\nrequired by ;as to pronounce divorce within one month counting from the date\nof the petition in case pf serious cause of divorce and within one year in other\ncases which period may be extended to five years in the latter case, by\nagreement of the parties. In all cases they are bound to deliver the\nsupplementary judgment within six months from the date of the judgment of\ndivorce. 4. It depends to a large extent on the substantive provisions of the law and to a\nmuch lesser extent on the agreement of the parties: the parties may regulate\ntheir pecuniary relations by the contract of marriage which, to be valid must be\nin writing and attested by four witnesses to or other contracts concluded during\nmarriage which must be approved by the family arbitrators for purposes of\nvalidity. To this extent the arbitrators may refer to agreements made between\nspouses. But in all other cases they are bound to refer to the provisions of the\nlaw. 5. Reconciliation is part and parcel of family arbitration: it is one of the legal\nduties of the arbitrators to be performed where there is no serious cause of\ndivorce. Unlike the Civil Code, the RFC provides for optional arbitration of family disputes. That\nis to say, the court is given the discretion to refer the case for arbitrators.",

    "text": "However, if the\nspouses do not agree to settle their disputes through arbitration, the court will dismiss the\ncase by giving them a cooling period of up to three months.175\nHence, as far as arbitration\nis concerned, the role of the court will be to advise the parties to solve through\narbitration. Where the reconciliation process either through the arbitrators or the cooling\nperiod fails, the court is duty bound to pronounce divorce within a month from the receipt\nof the arbitration report or end of the cooling period. The other important thing which needs to be accomplished by the court prior to the\npronouncement of divorce is to give a temporary order on maintenance of the spouses,\ncustody and maintenance of children and also of the management of the common\nproperty. The temporary order on these matters needs to be entered by the court\nimmediately after petition for divorce has been filed. The order also needs to consider as\nto manner of living of the spouses. The biggest question to be answered here is ‘Is it\npossible for the spouses to live in the same house? If not, who should leave the common\nabode?’ In this regard, what the law requires is for the court to take into consideration the\ninterest of children and the condition of the spouse who may be affected more by leaving\n176\nthe common abode. One corresponding issue which may be raised in relation to dissolution of marriage is the\nstatus of couples who were married but have ceased to live together for a long period of\ntime, but without securing divorce from the court. Can we consider the marriage to be\nstill intact? 175 Article 82/2 and 3 \n176 Article 82/6 RFC\nThis issue has been raised at different times to the courts. As discussed above, one of the\ncauses for dissolution of marriage, divorce, is to be pronounced only by the court. This\nmeans, when the law allows various ways of entering marriage which takes into account\nthe custom and religion of the parties concerned, such option is not open for divorce. What if one or both of the spouses have concluded another marriage, thinking that the\nprevious marriage is dissolved, even if there is no formal pronouncement of divorce by\nthe court? Can we consider the first marriage as existing? There are diverse views on this issue even among lawyers on this issue.",

    "text": "The RFC does not directly give response to this question. However, as can be\nseen from the divorce procedure itself, one of the obligations of the court is to speak to\nthe spouses either separately or jointly. Allowing divorce through representation will\nmake this requirement of the law meaningless. The court is expected to speak to the\nspouses directly, and not with the representatives or lawyers. Moreover, marriage in its\nvery nature is very personal. As a result, the law requires the personal appearance of the\nparties at the time of celebration of the marriage. This argument should also be extended\nto divorce cases. Hence, just like marriage, in case of divorce also the parties have\nappeared before the court personally unless for exceptional reasons they are exempted to\ndo so. For instance, in the case between Ato Mohammud vs. w/ro Ejigayehu the\napplication for divorce was made through representation and this fact was contested by\nthe respondent. The respondent claimed that since marriage and divorce are personal\nmatters, it is the claimant himself who should appear before the court. The court in that\ncase affirmed that divorce is very personal and hence in principle the parties have to\nappear before the court for divorce cases. On the other hand, the court also took into\nconsideration the exceptional circumstance in which representation may be allowed in\ndivorce cases. In that case, the claimant has sent also a letter though the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs which shows his clear intention of dissolving the marriage. As a result of\nthis letter and other evidences, the court granted the divorce, allowing divorce by\nrepresentation only in exceptional circumstances. The other thing which needs to be considered in relation to the dissolution of marriage is\nthe issue of compensation. As discussed above, both spouses will be treated equally in\nterms of the partition of common property. However, the law recognizes under article 84\nof the RFC the power of the court to award compensation to either of the parties. As discussed above, the Federal Family Code as well as the regional codes follow the no-\nfault divorce approach. In this regard, the first question which arises from the reading of\narticle 84 is whether or not fault has to be committed by one of the parties for the purpose\nof the application. As per the opinions of Ato Mehari, fault is not without any relevance\nin divorce cases.",

As the last sentence of article 84 states, the\npurpose of awarding compensation is to make good the damage sustained by the other\nspouse. One question which may be raised here is 'are we going to consider the damage\ncaused by the termination of the relationship or the damage caused by the fault that leads\n180 Mehari, 98-99\nto the termination of the relationship?' In response to his question, Wondwessen had\nmade the following findings:181\nIn contrast with the damage caused by the termination of the relationship,\ncourts have struggled to asses the damage caused by the fault that is found. In\nthe case of w/ro Alem vs Ato Lakew the plaintiff alleged the adulterous behavior\nof the respondent with her daughter was the ground for divorce. The first\nInstance court accepted her allegation and awarded 10,000 birr by way of\ncompensation for the damage caused by the fault committed by her husband. It\ndid not assess the damage caused by the divorce…. [ On the other hand, other\njudges from the Federal Supreme court] reflect a different view. The opinion is\nthat the damages to be compensated are those for termination of the\nmarriage…. The other important issue in connection with this article is determining the nature of the\ncompensation. Is article 84 referring to moral damage or material damage? Determination\nof this issue is very pertinent as the amount due in respect of each type of compensation\nvaries greatly. The view reflected by Ato Mehari is that the type of compensation referred\n182\nWhen the law generally refers to\nto under article 84 is both material and moral. 'damage' instead of specifically providing the nature, it implies that both types of damage\nare envisaged. The corresponding issue raised under article 84 is the amount of compensation payable. There is diverse view on the amount of the damage to be paid.",

    "text": "‘In the case of w/ro Sofia vs. Ato ketsela, the Federal Supreme court held that\nbecause the damage envisaged under article 84 was moral damage, the\ncompensation to be awarded should not exceed one thousand birr. In support of\nits conclusion, the court resorted to tile XIII of the Civil Code and cited article\n183\n2116/3…..’\n181 Wondwessen, 45-46 \n182 Mehari, 99 \n183 Wondwessen, 50\nThe other view in this respect is based on the assertion that article 84 refers both to the\nmoral as well as material damage. For instance, Ato Mehari holds the position that the\nparty who claims to have sustained damage should prove the amount of damage\nsustained; in a situation where assessing the damage is difficult, the court will decide by\nlooking into the circumstances.184\n5.2 Effects of Dissolution of Marriage\nAs you have seen in the preceding subsection, spouses may reach a point where they find\ntheir life together impossible and hence may resort to the dissolution of the marital\nconjugal. On the other hand, one of the spouses may pass away or is declared absent\nwhile the marital union is still intact, causing its disintegration. Conversely, the\ndisintegration of the family will have its own consequences on children born from the\nmarriage and the property acquired during the lifetime of the marriage. The next sections\ndiscuss these consequences. 5.2.1 Child Custody\nWhat does the best interest of the child mean? How is this principle reflected in Ethiopian\nlegal system? Persons who have lessened capacity cannot engage in any juridical act, and hence need to\nbe represented. Moreover, there is a presumption to the effect that persons with lessened\ncapacity do not distinguish what is good from what is bad, making the need for\nrepresentation more pertinent. One of such groups who have lessened capacity and need\nthe protection of others are minor children. When a marriage is dissolved through\ndivorce, one of the questions which need to be answered by the court is as to who should\nhave custody of those minor children. Custody of a minor child encompasses various set of rights and obligations under it, like\nthe right to live with the child in a shared residence, authority over the discipline of the\nchild and education as well as medical treatment. The visitation right of the non custodial\n184 Mehari, 100\nparent is also an issue to be determined at the time of deciding on the custody of the\nminor.",

    "text": "In earlier times, the views reflected by many legal systems shows that the father is\npreferred and trusted to take care of the minor children than the mother. As a result, there\nwas no debate as to the custody. This, however, has changed through time. Roman law vested absolute power in custodial matters in the father. In fact, in\nancient Rome a father could sell his children or even put them to death. By\ncontrast, a mother was not considered the child’s natural guardian, even where\nthe father died intestate. These rules eliminated custody disputes between\nparents in Roman courts, because the father’s will was practically absolute, and\nno amount of cruelty, neglect of duty or immorality on his part affected in the\nslightest degree his claim to the custody of his children. English law adopted the Roman view of absolute paternal power and right to\ncustody. .. a mother as such is entitled to no power, but only to reverence and\nrespect. The father has no right, however, to kill or sell a child. [ On the other\nhand], the broadly-stated paternal preference rule of England and Roman law\nnever gained a significant foothold in the United States; the American rule\nquickly became the “best-interest of the child”…. The “tender years” year doctrine, under which the mother was deemed to be the\nmore suitable custodian for young children, was developed in the mid 19th\ncentury. In 1813, one US court reasoned “ considering the children’s tender\nage, they stand in need of that kind of assistance, which can be afforded by none\nso well as a mother.” The presumption favoring the mother was justified both by\nthe assumed biological superiority of mothers as parents and by social custom,\nwhich assigned responsibility for parenting to mothers…..\nThe tender years presumption was the predominant rule for resolving custody\ndisputes through much of the twentieth century. It eroded in the 1970’s and has\nbeen abolished latter. The decline of the presumption can be attributed in part to\na general cultural rejection of the traditional ideal of clear gender roles. … Courts in the 1980’s described the tender years presumption as based on\n“outdated stereotypes”\nCurrently, what is envisaged under many laws is the principle of “best interest of the\nchild” in determining custody issues. The principle of the best interest is incorporated in\ndifferent international human right instruments. One of such international human right\ninstruments is the United Nations Convention on the Right of the Child.",

    "text": "Article 3 of the\nCRC states: ‘In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private\nsocial welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies,\nthe best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.’ Providing an authoritative definition of what this principle entails, however, has been one\nof the major problematic tasks. The concept of the “best interests” of children has been the subject of more\nacademic analysis than any other concept included in the Convention on the\nRights of the Child. In many cases, its inclusion in national legislation pre-dates\nratification of the Convention, and the concept is by no means new to\ninternational human rights instruments. The 1959 Declaration of the Rights of\nthe Child uses it in Principle 2: “The child shall enjoy special protection, and\nshall be given opportunities and facilities, by law and by other means, to enable\nhim to develop physically, mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a\nhealthy and normal manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity. In the\nenactment of laws for this purpose, the best interests of the child shall be the\nparamount consideration.” The principle is included in two articles of the 1979 Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: article 5(b)\nrequires States Parties to that Convention to “ensure that family education\nincludes a proper understanding of maternity as a social function and the\nrecognition of the common responsibility of men and women in the upbringing\nand development of their children, it being understood that the interest of\nchildren is the primordial consideration in all cases.” Similarly, article 16(1)(d)\nprovides that in all matters relating to marriage and family relations “the\ninterests of the children shall be paramount”. The Working Group drafting the Convention did not discuss any further\ndefinition of “best interests”, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child has\nnot as yet attempted to propose criteria by which the best interests of the child\nshould be judged in general or in relation to particular circumstances, aside\nfrom emphasizing that the general values and principles of the Convention\nshould be applied to the context in question.185\nOn the other hand, the committee on the implementation of the CRC has repeatedly\nstressed that the Convention should be considered as a whole and that emphasis should be\n186\ngiven to those principles which it had elevated to the status of general principle.",

    "text": "Hence, at the time of interpreting the principle of best interest of the child, resort should\nbe made to these three principles, i.e. the principles of non-discrimination, right to life\nand maximum survival and development, and respect for the views of the child. The\ndomestic laws o countries should also be in line with these requirements of the\nConvention. And consideration of best interests must embrace both short and long-term\nconsiderations for the child. Any interpretation of best interests must be\nconsistent with the spirit of the entire Convention – and in particular with its\nemphasis on the child as an individual with views and feelings of his or her own\nand the child as the subject of civil and political rights as well as special\nprotections. States cannot interpret best interests in an overly culturally\nrelativist way and cannot use their interpretation of “best interests” to deny\nrights now guaranteed to children by the Convention, for example to protection\n187\nagainst traditional practices and violent punishment. 185 Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 2002, UNICEF, pages \n41-43 \n186 Principles which have been elevated to the status of general principle are articles 2 on the \nelimination of any form of discrimination among children, article 3 best interest of the child, article \n6 on the right of the child to life and maximum survival and development as well as article 12 on \nrespect for the views of the child \n187 Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 2002, UNICEF, 42\nHowever, one also needs to be careful in that the best interest of the child will not be the\nonly consideration in any decision. What is required by the Convention is that the interest\nof the child being a primary consideration, not the sole consideration. This can be\ngathered from the last phrase of article 3/1 of the convention which says: “...shall be a\nprimary consideration”. Hence, other competing interests like the interest of other\nchildren and of adults needs to be considered as well; and the requirement under the\nConvention is that children’s interests have been explored and taken into account as a\nprimary consideration. The domestic laws of various countries have incorporated the three general principles in\ndifferent manners when they provide a guideline on the interpretation and application of\nthe principle of best interest of the child. For instance, the State of Minnesota statute of\n1997 came up with a list of various parameters to determine the best interest.",

The child’s cultural background…\nThese are some of the lists enumerated in the legislation. As can be observed, emphasis is\ngiven to the survival and manner of upbringing of the child as well as the views of the\nchild. 188 Ira mark Ellman, Family Law: cases, text, Problems, 621\nWhen we look into the Ethiopian family law on the issue of child custody, the Civil\nCode under article 681 requires the court to determine issues of child custody having\nregard solely to the interest of the children. The best interest of the child principle had\nacceptance even under the Civil Code. Hence, the courts have to investigate what would\nbe best for the child at the time of deciding as to where the child will be placed after the\ndissolution of the marriage. The “tender years” principle is also reflected under the same\narticle. Children under five years of age will be placed with their mother unless there is a\nreason for not doing so. It seems that the law gives priority for the mother because\nchildren under five years require the care and protection of their mother than their\nfather.189 However, if there is any reason in which the mother should not be granted\ncustody, the children may be placed with their father even if they are not five years of\nage. This can be seen from the first sentence of sub article 2 which qualifies the\napplication of the “tender years” doctrine on some grounds. Causes for such\ndisqualification of the mother could be, if the mother suffers from a disease as a result of\nshe cannot take care of the child.190\nThe 1995 FDRE Constitution under article 36 recognizes the different rights of children.

    "text": "Hence, on two grounds courts and any other bodies are\nrequired to look into the best interest of the child in determining any issue which affects\nthe child. First, by virtue of article 9/4 as well as 13/2 of the Constitution, international\ntreaties ratified by Ethiopia are the integral parts of the law. The CRC, which is ratified\nby Ethiopia, is made the integral law of the land, and hence reference must be made to it\nby the concerned organs at relevant times. Secondly, the Constitution itself mandates the\nobservance of the best interest of the child in all matters concerning children. As a result,\nthe actions of public organs, courts as well as legislatures should take into account this\nprinciple. 189 Dr. Kifle, 122 \n190 Dr Kifle, 122\nArticle 113 of the RFC deals with the role of the court in determining custody of children\nafter the pronouncement of divorce. By virtue of this article, there are three questions to\nbe addressed by the court at the time of determining custody case. The first is who should\nhave custody of the child? The second question is in relation to the maintenance of the\nchild, how much should the non custodial parent give for the maintenance of the child? The third important question is the right of the non custodial parent to visit the child. How often should this visitation be? For how long can the non custodial parent stay with\nthe child and other related questions are to be given a response by the court. In relation to the question of custody, the RFC provides guidelines which need to be\nobserved by the court. First of all, if the divorce is made by mutual consent, the parties\nare also expected to determine the consequences of their divorce, including custody of\ntheir children, by their agreement.191\nHowever, in the case of any other divorce, article\n221/2 gives the mandate to the court to determine as to who should be the guardian or\ntutor of the child. In doing so, the court is expected to observe the guidelines enumerated\nunder article 113/2. These guidelines include consideration of income, age, health and\ncondition of living of spouses on the one hand and the age and interest of the child on the\nother hand. The requirements under this sub article are derived by the principle of the\nbest interest of the child. As mentioned earlier, the best interest principle takes into\nconsideration the principles of non discrimination, right of the child to life, survival as\nwell as respect for the views of the child.",

    "text": "So, the decision to be made is ‘which one of the\ntwo parents can best provide the things necessary for the child to achieve his right to life,\nsurvival, development and respect of his views?’ Obviously, the answer to this question\ndepends on the age, health and income as well as living condition of the spouses. However, care should be made not to assume that the financially well to do parent is\nalways in a position to provide the necessities of the child. Bringing up a child involves\nnurturing the behavior of the child as a result of with the living condition and also of the\nbehaviors of the parent need to be considered. On top of this, interpretation of the best\ninterest of the child requires one to consider the view of the child. Hence, if the child is in\n191 Article 221/1 RFC\na position to manifest his wishes, the court should seek to find out. However, care needs\nto be made at this time. ‘ The court should ascertain that the child’s choice was not a\nresult of undue influence from the chosen parent, as there is a strong possibility of the\nparent withinterim custody to counsel the child to his or her choice. This influence may\nassume different forms; that which tends to convince the child that one of his parents is\nbetter than the other,  that which manipulates the child’s immature desire for less\ndiscipline or restraint; or simple attempts by one parent to turn the child against the\nother parent. ’192\n193\nIn the case between w/ro Martha Hailemariam vs. Ato Berhane Derso\n, the father had\ninterim custody of the child who was five years old. The court, at the time of deciding on\ncustody, requested the opinion of the child. The child responded that he wants to be with\nhis father because his father could take him to good school, buy him things that he needs\nand also because his mother is a bad person. Considering the age of the child, which was\nonly 5 years, the court stated that the child cannot by himself, without the influence of the\nfather say such things about his mother, and by considering other factors, it awarded\ncustody to the mother. When seeking the opinion of the child, two factors need to be considered. The first one is\nage of the child. The court has to be sure that the child has reached the age group in\nwhich he can make a reasonable preference.",

    "text": "For instance the Statute of Georgia provides\n194\nthat a child of 14 years have the right to select the parent with whom he desires to live. Hence, under that law, the court will listen to the opinion of the child if that child has\nattained 14 years of age. On the other hand, other statutes instead of limiting the age,\nprovide for the child’s preference to be considered and given weight if it reflects a level\nof mature judgment.195\nHence, in the second situation, the court is required to make its\nown assessment of the preference of the child. 192 Wondwesson, 31 \n193 File number 476/93 \n194 Ellman, 652 \n195 Ellman, 653\nThe preference of the child is also to some degree influenced by the circumstances in\nwhich he is interviewed. So, the second essential thing which needs to be considered is\nthe environment in which the child’s preference is to be obtained. The presence of the\nparents may intimidate the child, and hence it is better if the court interviews the child\nwithout the presence of the parents. All in all, one can conclude that child custody determinations under the best interest\nstandard differ significantly from other forms of adjudication. Their difference pertains to\nthe following196\nFirst, child custody determinations are ‘person-oriented’ disputes. Most legal\nrules require a determination of the fact relating to some event and are thus\n‘act-oriented’. Child custody determinations under the best interest standard, in\ncontrast, are ‘person-oriented’ making relevant “the attitudes, dispositions,\ncapacities and shortcomings of each parent”\nSecondly, child custody determinations require predictions about the future. Most adjudications require determinations of past acts and facts. Child custody\ndetermination under best interest standard, on the other hand, requires\nindividualized predictions; with whom will this child be better off in the years to\ncome? The regional laws have also incorporated the best interest standard with slight difference\nin some regions. The family laws of Amhara, Oromiya and Tigray Regional States have\n197\nmade reference to the ‘tender years’ principle\nThe best interest standard is also given more emphasis in the recent decision of the\nCassation Division of the Federal Supreme Court in cassation file no. 23632. In that case,\nthe parents of the child were separated at early age of the child, and the child was living\nwith his aunt (sister of his mother).

The case was brought to the cassation court by the aunt. The cassation court, in determining who should have custody of the child reasoned that\nthe best interest of the child should be always a priority as is required by the Constitution\nas well as CRC, which is the integral part of the law of land. And all laws concerning\nchildren should be interpreted in light of this principle. With this major reasoning, the\ncourt awarded custody to the aunt, rather than the father. Two important points emerged\nout of this decision. First, international treaties ratified by Ethiopia are confirmed to be\npart and parcel of the law of the land and hence the courts have to resort to these\ninternational instruments by the mere fact of ratification, i.e. without requiring their\ninterpretation in the working language of the court. Secondly, the best interest of the child\nstandard is always to be observed and the courts have to make sure the compatibility of\nthe provisions of the law to this standard on a case by case basis. One other thing which needs to be considered about custody decisions is the possibility of\nrevision of the decision with change in circumstances. As stipulated under article 113/3,\nthe court is given the power to revise decision of custody and maintenance with change in\ncircumstances. 5.2.2 Liquidation of Pecuniary Relations\nThe matrimonial property is indivisible for the time being the marriage stayed intact. One\nof the issues which need to be addressed by the court at the time of pronouncing divorce\nis the partition of the matrimonial property. The law has given discretion for the spouses\nto agree upon the management of their property. This discretion is also extended in\nrespect of the partition of property. If the parties have addressed the issue of property in\ntheir contract of marriage as per article 83/3, then the contract will be effected by the\ncourt. However, if there is no contract of marriage or if the contract of marriage concluded is\nnot valid, then the court has to decide on the right of the parties in respect of the\nproperties. As discussed in chapter three, there is a presumption that all property in\nmarriage is common property of the spouses.",

    "text": "Introduction\nAs you may understand, there are various intimate relationships between men and\nwomen. Among these relationships, marriage formally concluded has remained\nthroughout the world a fundamental relationship. That is why society and the law give\nrecognition and protection to the institution of marriage. Despite this, on account of\nvarious reasons, men and women live together as a husband and a wife without\nconcluding formal marriage. It is this aspect of non-marital relationship that you will\nstudy under this chapter. Therefore, this chapter will concentrate on the meaning of such\nnon-marital cohabitation, (irregular union to use the parlance of the law), the need to\nprotect such relationship, the legal effects of such union, proof and termination of\nirregular union. Here, one thing that you need to bear in mind is that because the\nprovisions of regional family laws on irregular union have made no departure from the\nRevised Family Code of the Federal Government, no mention of regional family codes\nwill be made in order to avoid an unnecessary duplication of legal provisions. 6.2. Objectives\nAfter completing this chapter, students will be able to:\n- \ndiscus the essence of irregular union. - \ndifferentiate irregular union from marriage. - \nanalyze the need to protect irregular union. - \nanalyze the effects of irregular union. - \ndiscuss modes of proof of irregular union\n- \ndiscuss termination of irregular union. - \napply the rules on irregular union to actual life situations. 6.3. The Concept of Irregular Union\nAlthough the living together of a man a and woman in marriage has been considered the\nmost socially desirable relationship, different kinds of close relationships between men\nand women have existed in different societies. Those relationships perform partly the\nfunction of marriage producing similar effects as marriage. The existence of irregular\nunion and its significance throughout the world is not debatable and various terms have\nbeen used to denote this relationship depending upon the prevailing religious, cultural\nand political situations. In Ethiopia, irregular union has been recognized by the 1960 Civil Code although such\nunion is not a recent phenomenon. As it has existed since long ago. Currently, there are a\nnumber of couples living in such relationship for various reasons. Besides, the Ethiopian\nsociety, as a multi-cultural society, has undergone fundamental transformation in matters\nof sexual companionship, marriage and family formation.

    "text": "In this regard, another author writes:\n“Fundamental shifts in attitudes within a society are very often \naccompanied by rapid swings in the usage of particular \nlanguage. The choice of legal terminology should thus follow the \nchanges of attitudes about non-marital cohabitation for \notherwise the law appears to be even more archaic than is in fact \nthe case because it is couched in terminology redolent of another \nage. A choice of language which brands this relationship with \nmoral disapprobation is out of touch with the views of \nsubstantial segment of the community. In fact, modern usage has \nnot clearly evolved to provide an everyday word that is certain \nin its meaning and correct in its moral tone” (Peter Sparks, \n“The Language of Cohabitation,” Family Law Quarterly Vol.19, \np.328). In Ethiopia, the 1960 Civil the Code the Revised Family Code of the Federal Government\nand the new regional family laws use the term irregular union. ( See Arts. 788-721 of the\ncivil code, Art 18 of the Revised family code (RFC) and the relevant provisions of the\nregional Family laws). If you were one of the drafters of the Ethiopian family laws, would you employ the\nterm “irregular union? Why? Why not? Although there are various terms to the relationship under consideration, we\nconventionally use the term irregular union as used in the laws and try to define it as\nsuch. In legal theory, the term is defined as the union of a man and woman established solely\nby the consent of both parties. Like the institution of marriage, it is intended to be\npotentially indefinite in duration and the parties cohabit in the same household as a man\nand wife. Actual domestic cohabitation is essential. In other words, cohabitation does not\nmean mere sexual gratitification. Rather it means to live together, to have the same\nhabitation. ( Read P., Sarcevic, “Cohabitation without Marriage: The Yugoslavian\nExperience,” American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol.29 No 2, 1981, p. 315. What do you understand by cohabitation? What constitutes cohabitation? Because cohabitation is the essential element of irregular union, it is necessary to have a\nclear picture as to what is meant by this word? Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term as:\n“To live together as husband and wife; the mutual assumption of \nthose marital rights, durations and obligations which are usually \nmanifested by married people, including but not necessarily \ndependent on sexual relations”.

    "text": "H.C. Black, Black’s Law \nDictionary (6th ed, 1990, p.260). What do you understand from this definition? From the above definition, it is possible to\ngather that the parties (necessarily a man and a woman in Ethiopia) to an irregular union\nlive as husband and wife, assume mutually and voluntarily those rights, duties and\nobligations which are also assumed in the institution of marriage. Despite the fact that the\nabove definition demonstrates the outward similarity between marriage and irregular\nunion, it appears to be confusing as regards what rights, duties and obligations are\nassumed by the parties when evaluated in the light of the limited recognition given to this\nrelationship in the laws of many countries. In Ethiopia, the first legal instrument which tried to define irregular union is Art.708 of\nthe Civil Code which provides that an irregular union is the state of fact which is created\nwhen a man and a woman live together as husband and wife without having contracted\nmarriage. Art.709 of the code gives further explanation by stating that:\n(1) It is necessary and sufficient in order to have an irregular union that the behaviors\nof the man and of the woman be analogous to that of married people. (2) They need not represent themselves to third parties as being married. (3) The mere fact that a man and a women keep up sexual relations between them,\neven if repeatedly and notoriously, is not sufficient by itself to constitute an\nirregular union between such man and woman. What has been provided under Art.709 of the Civil Code has been reiterated by Art.99 of\nthe Revised Family Code and the regional family laws. By having a close reading of these articles, it is possible to understand that irregular\nunion is established where the relationship is analogous to marriage. It is this analogy\nwhich is the distinguishing feature of irregular union as compared to other male-female\nrelationships. It is because of this feature that irregular union is quite different from what\nis known in Ethiopia as “kept woman” or “kimit” whereby the man keeps the woman\nmainly for sexual gratification and as a sign of social position and prestige to whom the\nwomen also gives emphasis to the financial position and social standing of the man who\nserves as her patron and benefactor. It has been said above that irregular union is analogous to marriage. How do you explain\nthe analogy between marriage and irregular union? In what respects irregular union\nanalogous to marriage? Try to compare and contrast the institution of marriage and\nirregular union.",

    "text": "Generally, according to a certain author, two important elements may be drawn as\nregards the similarity between marriage and irregular union:\n“The first element is composed of intimate life as between husband and \nwife and is founded on the relationship of affection and love, devotion and \nloyalty, that is indicative of their having pledged themselves to common \nfate. This actual domestic cohabitation is essential. The second element is \nthe running of a common household, not simply out of personal need, \nconvenience, narrow financial considerations, or as a self- standing \narrangement, but as a natural function of the joint family life, as is \ncustomary and usual between husband and wife attached to each other by \nthe bond of common destiny. A household of this kind is different from, for \ninstance, the situation of employing a housemaid or a nursemaid, even \nthough it happens that the employer engages in sexual relations with her.” (D. Friedman, The “Unmarried Wife in Israel,” Israel Yearbook on \nHuman Rights, Vol.2(1972) p.290). 6.4. Why Do People Live in an Irregular Union? Why do you think do a man and a woman live together without concluding formal\nmarriage? Traditionally, the relationship of unmarried cohabitees was considered to be meretricious\nand usually criminal as well. People forming such union were thought to be scoundrels. In contradistinction to this, the family based on marriage was and is favored by\nlegislatures and courts as the desirable and productive unit of society. The descriptions\nconnoting severe moral disapprobation such as meretrials or living-in-sin could not,\nhowever, deter people from forming such unions. According to one writer, the legal and much of the social stigma of illegitimacy is gone. Whatever implications it may have to the institution of marriage, irregular unions is both\nincreasingly prevalent and increasingly being recognized as a theoretically defensible\nlifestyle and contrary to the widely held public opinion, some of these unions outlast the\npresent day ceremonial marriages”. ( C.S, Bruch, “Property Rights of Defacto Spouses\nIncluding Thought or the Value of Home Maker’s Services,” Family Law Quarterly,\nVol.10, No.2 1976 pp.101-102). There are actual and possible reasons that necessitate living in an irregular union in the\nworld in general and in Ethiopia in particular. Generally, the reasons encompass roots in\ncultures of societies that have accepted or tolerated informal families, socio-economic\nchanges and especially in Ethiopia absence of knowledge of the legal consequences of\none’s relationship with another.",

    "text": "Although there is no an empirical research conducted on\nthe area, it is generally believed that in Ethiopia there are a number of people living in an\nirregular union in which one or both parties believe that their relationship is marriage\nwhile it is not from the view point of the law. As an alternative to marriage concluded in accordance with the requirements of the law,\nirregular union is not a result of the sexual revolution experienced by the modern world. With no doubt, a man and woman have lived together since time immemorial without\nconcluding marriage. ( Read Tilahun Teshome, work cited previously and A. Skolnick,\n“Social context of cohabitation,” American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol.29, No. 2\n1981 p.350) According to O. Donovan, irregular union has a long history but has only\nrecently moved back from the sinful category into the acceptable behavior category. The\nrevival has, of course, been aided by the gradual social and psychological changes in\nmatters of sexual conduct, marriage and family formation to which the laws of different\ncountries have been responding. ( O’ Donovan, “Legal Marriage-Who Needs It?” The\nModern Law Review, Vol.47, N. 1 1984 p.114. Besides, read Tilahun Teshom’s work\ncited previously). Historically, in almost all earliest societies, marriages and irregular union existed side by\nside although each had their own effects in the existing system. Although after the spread\nof Christianity in Europe, Christianity vehemently condemned all sex relations unless\nconcecrated by indissoluble marriage and exalted celibacy over the latter, it continued\nduring the early centuries to sanction in practice the established Roman and Barbarian\nusages of having a concubine. The tacit toleration of concubinage did not give place to\ngeneral reprobation in catholic and protestant countries until after the protestant\nreformation. Then the legal disabilities attaching to the relationship to the relation\nbecome added the ruthless penalties of social condemnation and ostracism. Finally,\nalthough it was originally a legitimate form of union (as marriage), later it became\nillegitimate and then illicit and immoral. (Read the discussions made in this regard by\nRobert Briffault in Encyclopedia of the Social sciences, Vol.4 1931, pp.171-173). It is obvious that Ethiopia is one of the earliest countries which accepted Christianity. Despite this, much of the matters relating to marriage have been governed by customs\neven in the Christian community. Strict adherence to the rules of Christianity in matters\nof marriage such as receiving the Holy Communion on marriages is still considered as\nsomething to be observed by deacons and priests alone.",

    "text": "As regards the law, concubine\nwas prohibited by the Fetha Negast which provides:\n“Having a concubine is forbidden in our saintly law since it is contrary to lawful\nmarriage,- (it) is continuous fornication. If there is one who has a concubine and if she is\nhis slave, he must abstain and marry according to the law…No man shall be permitted to\nlive with a concubine in his house…If he likes to live with her, he must marry her\naccording to requirements of lawful marriage…who has a wife and illicit relations with\nhis woman slave shall be punished”. ( The Fetha Nagast, chapter 25, translated from Geez\nby Abba Paulos Tsadua, Faculty of Law, Haileselassie I University, 1968, p.279). Although concubinage was categorically prohibited by the Feta Nagast, the traditional\npractice continued as there was no effective way of communication between state\nofficials and the people which would enable the general public to be aware of the law. Let alone in the past, even today such relationship is preserved in the countryside. In addition, every society has undergone profound transformation in the 20th century\nresulting in, inter alia, new attitudes about marriage, sexual companionship and family\nformation. Today (in the 21st century) marriage is not always viewed as either a\nsacrament or a status necessarily extablished for life. Rather, there is a shift from\ninstitutional to companionship marriage. According to the suggestion of one study, many\nmarriages, if not all, are utilitarian relationships based on convenience, economic benefits\nand mutual affection, the systematic understanding and the comradeship of the spouses. So, the rise of non-marital cohabitation may represent a working out the logic of\ncompanionship without the institution of legal marriage at all. (W.D. Wyrauch,\n“Metamorphoses of Marriage”, Family Law Quarterly, Vol.13, No4 (1980) p.420). In addition to the historical background of non-marital cohabitation (irregular union) and\nthe cultural transformations, people may choose irregular union over marriage due to\ndifferent motivations. Some couples feel that the commitments and burdens of marriage outweigh its\nadvantages and hence engage in irregular union. The other reason is that no costly legal\nprocedures are required to establish and terminate the relationship. Besides, irregular\nunion, as a de facto relationship, gives the opportunity to define and specify the terms of\ntheir relationship individually. They can define the terms of their personal property\nrelations freely irrespective of the essential rights and duties which are inherently and\ncompulsorily attached to a formal marriage.",

    "text": "It is believed that for some women, an irregular union confers upon them freedom from\nthe old-age and world-wide gendered-biased oppression through traditional male\ndominance to concluding a formal marriage. ( H.D. Krause, Family Law in a Nutshell 3rd\ned., 1995, pp.71-72). Do you agree with this assertion? Why/why not? There are also some additional reasons which make couples enter into an irregular union. Motivations of economic nature are the first. It may also happen that the parties decline to\ngo through a marriage ceremony. As a result, they simply agree to live together without\nany ceremony or formality. Financial constraints in affording the expenses of a wedding,\nthe presence of legal impediments (for instance the inability of obtaining divorce for\nthose who have already concluded an indissoluble marriage) militate against formal\nmarriage). ( C. Foote, R.J. Leuy and F.E.A Sander, Cases and Materials on Family Law\n2nd ed., 1976 pp.708). As regards why people live together in an irregular union, a writer summarizes:\n“In my opinion, the main reason for why people live in irregular \nunion is the unawareness of the parties, usually women, about \nwhat constitutes customary marriage in the eyes of the law from \nthe many cases brought by women to our courts [Ethiopian \ncourts] based on an alleged marriage or to establish one’s status \nas a surviving spouse of the deceased, it is easy to guess that the \nparties lived [together] believing that they were married while \nthey were not so. Some may also live in an irregular union\nknowing that they are not married but one party, usually the \nwomen, may fear that raising the issue of marriage will end the \nrelationship, perhaps because of her economic dependence or \nshe may hope that they will get married in the future”. (Birru Gebeyehu, Problems Arising Out of Non-marital Cohabitation: Ethiopian\nExperience,\nAddis Ababa University, Faculty of Law, Senior Thesis, unpublished 2000,\np.8).

    "text": "As you may have undress and from the previous units, in all societies, the family has\nbeen the prime mechanism which serves as a bridge for linking individuals to the larger\nsociety for providing them with the motivation to participate in the economic and\noccupational structure of the society, and for protecting them from the harnesses of that\nparticipation by providing effective emotional support and a sense of individual dignity\nand security. If the traditional legal regulation of marriage, an old legal institution as a union of man\nand women uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is\nto protect and preserve the family, some argue that there is no reason that irregular union\nis not protected by law since the living situation in an irregular union is as much as\nfamiliars as marriage (L.J. Weitzman, “Legal Regulation of Marriage: Tradition and\nchange;” California Law Review, Vol.62, No 4 (1974) p.12 42). Generally, legal\nregulation of marriage serves four state interests: promoting public morality, ensuring\nfamily stability, assuring support obligations and assigning responsibility for the care of\nchildren (Ibid). The states traditional interest in promoting public morality was thought to\nbe saved by requiring and regulating legal marriage. Some argue that allowing persons to\nengage in sexual relationships without first going through marriage ceremony results in\ndecline in public morality. The law of marriage protects society against being confounded\nby laxity of morals, promiscuity, free love and generally profligacy. While this view\nmight be accurate in the past, present standards of public morality are such that it is not\nunusual for people to have intimate relations or to live together without marrying. Further, one may seriously question the legitimacy of the state’s interest in regulating\nintimate personal relations under the banner of “promoting public morality.” ( Ibid). Evaluate this above assertion in the light of the current Ethiopian situation. In relation to preserving public morality, religious authorities raise strong opposition to\nthe entire phenomena of irregular union. Their attitude is that the religions monopoly in\nmatters of men-women relationships should remain unimpaired. Despite this, it should be\ntaken into account that, religious law cannot always give answers to many problems in\nthe domain of personal laws as far as the secular public is concerned.",

    "text": "Moreover, in areas\nwhere there are cultural and religious diversities and where there is separation of state\nand religion as is the case in Ethiopia today, it cannot be appropriate for the legislature of\na secular government to take an overly restricted ideological attitude concerning people’s\nprivate choices of life. Some writers have made it clear that irregular union was as old or\neven older than the institution of marriage (see for instance the discussions made by\nTilahun Teshome, work cited previously, pp.65-71). Despite this, its legal protection and regulation is of a recent phenomena compared to the\ninstitution of marriage. In spite of its long history, the unmarried opposite-sex conjugal\nrelationship has not been a subject of legal protection and regulation for the reasons\nmentioned above. However, as time went by, the de facto relationship of a man and\nwoman was changed from the sinful category into the category of acceptable behavior. People who wouldn’t have considered such a relationship many years ago began to\nopenly cohabit without concluding a formal marriage. The social disapproval and stigma\nof a de facto union faded into the background. In short, irregular union has become more\nacceptable and a frequent social behavior becoming relatively stable and sometimes\noutlasting ceremonial marriages. This gave an impetus to the growing need of the legal\nregulation of irregular unions in many jurisdictions (C.S. Bruch, “property Rights of De\nfacto Spouses including Thoughts on the Value of Homemaker’s services,” Family Law\nQuarterly, Vol.10, No 1-4 (1978) p.101,). As the objective reality on the ground shows, a great number of people do live together as\nhusband and wife without having undergone a formal marriage. Although irregular union\ndoes not comply with the formality required by laws, an irregular union creates a family,\nchildren are born to such union, a man and a woman like marriage. Seen from economic,\nsocial and psychological perspectives, irregular unions are functionally identical to\nmarriage. What happens in the family created by marriage happens in the family created\nby an irregular union. This is the visible social reality. Hence, failing to give legal\nrecognition and protection to such relationship is unfair. Hardships and injustice would\nresult unless the law intervenes and regulates such relationships to the extent necessary. Reasons of equality like the protection of children born in a de facto union or the\nprotection of the weaker party in the union justify the recognition of a de facto\nrelationship.",

One can imagine the injustice that would occur in the absence of legal\nrecognition and protection of irregular unions (Refer to the following materials: N. Bala\nand R. Jaremko,” Non-marital Unions, Finality of Separation Agreements and Children\nIssues,” The International Survey of Family Law, 2002; S. o. Pais,” Defacto\nRelationships and Same Sex Relationships in Portugal,” The International Survey of\nFamily Law, (2002). Coming to the Ethiopian situation, it was the 1960 Civil Code of the Empire of Ethiopia\nwhich gave recognition and protection to irregular union although the protection was\nmuch less than the protection given to such relationship by the current family laws of the\ncountry and other jurisdictions. As you can see from the discussions made under the previous chapters of this course\nmaterial, the need to revise the 1960 Civil Code on matters of family was felt and the first\nmove was made in the middle of 1980s (Tilahun Teshome, “Reflections on the Revised\nFamily Code of 2000;” The International Survey of Family Law (2002) p.165). A\ncommittee was established with a view to reforming the family law. The committee came\nup with a draft family law for consideration by the pertinent bodies. However, the work\ndid not continue for reasons that were not made known. ( Ibid). After the change of government in 1991, the move towards family law reform was begun\nanew. The need for family law reform was strongly felt following the adoption of the\n1995 Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia since the constitution\nensured equality of sex in all respects while that was not the case under the 1960 Civil\nCode. Besides, the FDRE Constitution has provided that family is the fundamental unit of\nsociety and it needs protection by the state and the society. Hence, because family law\ngives recognition and protection to irregular union is in line with the constitution. In\naddition to the FDRE Constitution, Art.16(3) of the UDHR, which has been made part\nand parcel of the Ethiopian law since the adoption of the 1991  Transitional charter of the\ncountry, the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to\nprotection by society and the state. This is also reiterated under Art.23(1) of the\nconvention n civil and political rights to which Ethiopian is a party.",

    "text": "During the drafting process of the Revised Family Code the FDRE, irregular union was\none of the areas which provoked heated debates in the various public discussions held in\ndifferent forums. Generally, two opposing views were reflected in the discussions. The\nfirst view objected to the recognition and protection of irregular union while the other\nview was in favor of recognition of irregular union. Those who opposed the recognition\nof irregular union argued that the only constitutionally recognized relationship between a\nman and a woman is marriage. The FDRE Constitution is not concerned with irregular\nunion nor does it recognize it specifically as it did so with marriage. Hence, it was\nargued, it should be for the protection of the institution of marriage that the government\nhas to enact laws. Enacting laws for the protection and regulation of irregular union is not\njustified which was not envisaged by the constitution. Moreover, it was maintained that\nirregular union is unacceptable by various religions. The group contended that giving\nrecognition to irregular union would undermine the institution of marriage and endanger\nthe sanctity of marriage. Members of this group further strengthened their position by\nmaintaining that since irregular can easily be terminated at any time at the wish of the\npartners, it is detrimental to the interests of children and women in particular and the\nsociety in general. The proponents of the second view, the view that advocates the recognition and\nprotection of irregular union, however, strongly argued that the view that irregular union\nis not recognized by the FDRE Constitution is not acceptable. The silence of the\nconstitution about irregular union does not amount to non-recognition. Since the\nconstitution does not specifically deny recognition to it, protecting and regulating\nirregular union by enacting specific law is not contrary to the ideals of the constitution. Furthermore, this group argued that, the phenomenon of the living together of a man and\na woman as husband and wife without concluding marriage is a fact that has been\ncommonly practiced by the Ethiopian community for many years. It is also a practice\nprevalent in the urban areas of Ethiopia (Mehari Redae, Yeteshashalawn ye Beteseb Hig\nLemegenzeb yemiredu Andand Netiboch\nVol.1 1995 E.C pp.120-127). The reality on the ground as to irregular union is that a number of people are presently\ninvolved in this relationship and it is more likely that a number of people who will\ninvolve in such union will increase in the future for various reasons (Ibid).",

    "text": "As has been\nmentioned previously, many people enter into this kind of relationship due to economic\nproblems, inability to get the assent of their parents for marriage or failure to fulfill\ncustomary obligations, inability to cover expenses for wedding ceremonies and the like. Hence, denial of such reality is impossible since to do so would be tantamount to “closing\none’s eyes not to see the visible social reality.” The other argument of the second group was based on the protection of the rights of\nwomen. The absence of legal recognition to irregular union is detrimental to women\nparticularly from the view point of common property. Would this argument be tenable\nif women were economically strong? Despite the above arguments against the recognition of irregular union, it was the second\nview that was accepted by the legislature and the Revised Family Code of FDRE and\nRegional Family Laws have accorded better protection to irregular union as compared to\nthe protection given to it in the 1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia. What departures have the\ncurrent family laws of Ethiopia made from the 1960 Civil Code as far is irregular\nunion is concerned? 6.6. Legal Effects of Irregular Union\n6.6.1. Introductory Remarks\nUnder the previous units, you have understood that marriage produces legal effects-\npersonal as well as pecuniary effects where it is established in accordance with the\nrequirements set forth by the law. Now the question that may cross your mind here is\nwhether or not the requirements that must be fulfilled in case of marriage (essential\nconditions of marriage without which no valid marriage is established) are also to be\nfulfilled in irregular union. The 1960 Civil Code as well as the current family laws of Ethiopia do not say any thing\nas to the requirements for the formation of a valid irregular union. ( Read for instance,\nArt. 708-721 of the Civil Code, Arts. 120-130 of the family law of Tigray, Arts. 128-139\nof the family law of Oromia  Arts. 109-118 of Amhara Family Code). Does this mean that irregular union can be formed between two minor couples? Can it be\nformed against the will of one of the partners? How about other impediments to\nmarriage? Although the laws are silent, it is not possible to maintain that any one under any\ncondition whatsoever can form irregular union, as he/she pleases, with another opposite\nsex. The condition that need to be satisfied in marriage must be satisfied in irregular\nunion too. Do you agree? Why/Why not?",

    "text": "(A) Consent\nCohabitation without marriage (irregular union) is defined as the union of a man and a\nwoman established solely by the consent of both parties (P. Sarcevic, “Cohabitation\nwithout Marriage: The Yugoslavian Experience,” American Journal of Comparative Law,\nVol.29, No (1981) P.315). By  the same token, under the draft provisions of the Civil\nCode prepared by Rene David, temporary union or concubinage was included resulting\nfrom a legal agreement other than marriage between a man and a woman to cohabit\nduring a limited or indefinite period. This was replaced by the codification commission’s\ndefinition of irregular union in Art.708 of the Civil Code as a mere state of fact. This\nchange did not, however, mean the irregular union does not require the consent of the\nparties. No one can be forced to do anything without his consent. ( Read Birru Gebeyehu,\nwork cited previously)\n(B) Capacity\nIn the Civil Code, the RFC and Regional Family Laws, one of the essential conditions of\nmarriage is capacity although this not provided in irregular union. Despite this, based on\nthe nature and requirements of a valid juridical act, incapables do not have the requisite\nability to comprehend the nature and consequences of juridical acts. Capacity in marriage\nrefers to the attainability of marriageable age as defined by law and mental capacity. Regarding age, the FDRE Constitution under Art.34(1) provides that marriage is\nconcluded when the spouses attain the marriageable age. The marriageable age is\ndetermined by the Ethiopian family laws to be eighteen years of age for both spouses. The family laws do not, however, have comparable provisions which expressly or\nimpliedly prohibit the formation of irregular union by minors. In spite of the absence of\nsuch provisions, it is tenable to maintain that the minimum age limit prescribed for\nmarriage should be applicable to irregular union by taking into account the policy\nconsideration for the requirement of age and from the view point of protecting children. Do you agree with conclusion? Why/Why not? (C) Prohibited Degrees\nIn Ethiopia, both under customary law and codified laws, marriage between persons\nrelated within certain degrees (either by consanguinity or affinity) was prohibited and the\nsocial taboos against incest have been reinforced by the criminal law. From 1960 to the\nestablishment of the   Federal system in Ethiopia, the 1960 Civil Code was meant to be\nuniformly applied throughout Ethiopia since Ethiopia before 1991 was a unitary state.",

    "text": "Hence marriage between blood relatives up to the seventh degree was prohibited (Art.551\nand Art.582 of the Civil Code). Coming to the current situations, degrees of consanguinal\nrelationships differ from region to region since each region is constitutionally empowered\nto come up with its own family law reflecting its social and cultural realities. Any ways,\nalthough the degree varies, each regional family law prohibits marriage between blood\nrelatives. ( Read Art.8 of the Revised family code, Art.3 of the family code of Amhara\nand Art.27 of the Family Code of Oromia, and Arts.19 and 18 of the SNNP Family Code,\nfor instance. However, the same prohibition is not noticeable under the Ethiopian family laws as\nregards irregular union. But by taking into account the rationale behind prohibition of\nmarriage between persons who are relatives by consanguinity, it is possible to conclude\nthat it is not acceptable to form an irregular union by violating the prohibitions provided\nby law. Another prohibition both under the Civil Code and the current family laws is marriage\nbetween affines. However, the degree of prohibition varies from region to region as you\ncan understand by having a look at the relevant provisions of the law. (D) Other Impediments\nFrom the above discussions, it is possible to conclude that consent, capacity and\nfulfillment of conditions with regard to consanguinal and affinal relationships are\nelements of formation of a valid irregular union. How about period of widowhood and\nthe existence of another irregular union? The purpose of making a woman to observe period of widowhood (180 days in Ethiopia)\nis to avoid the conflict of paternity. If that is the case, can’t we make a woman to observe\nthis prohibition since one of the main effects of irregular union, as we will see later, is\npresumption of paternity for children born of an irregular union? In marriage, the\njustification for prohibiting remarriage before the lapse of a period of widowhood is that\nconflict of paternity will arise since marriage has clear beginning. However, although\nmany irregular unions may have beginnings which the public cannot in any way\nascertain, it is desirable, to make our policy consistent, to provide a period of widowhood\nduring which an irregular union cannot be formed where such irregular union can have\nascertainable and definite beginning. Otherwise, the same problem feared in case of\nremarriage will occur. Another point worth raising at this juncture is whether an existing irregular union\nconstitutes a bar to form another irregular union. The law does not have clear provisions\nin this regard.",

    "text": "How would you go about this issue? 6.6.2. Legal Effects of Irregular Union\n(A) General Considerations\nAs has been discussed in our previous discussions, irregular union existed in Ethiopia\nlong before the adoption of the 1960 Civil Code. The 1960 Civil Code also gave\nrecognition to such union and regulated the effects of such a union in relation to certain\nmatters. However, the new family laws of the country have made departures from the\n1960 Civil Code. The major departure is the creation of community property. On the\nfollowing pages, discuss the most important effects of irregular union as incorporated\nunder the Ethiopian Family Codes (Note that since the provisions of regional family laws\nare verbatim copies of the Revised Family Code, we may not reproduce the provisions of\neach regional family law. Hence, citing the relevant provision of the Revised Family\nCode suffices to avoid unnecessary repetitions). (B) Absence of Bond of Affinity\nValid marriage creates a bond of affinity between the man and the relatives of the woman\nand vice versa. Consequently, marriage between person related by affinity in the direct\nline and marriage between a woman and the brother of her husband or marriage between\na man and the sister of his wife is forbidden. As you will note under chapter Nine, as a\nconsequence of the creation of bond of affinity in marriage, the obligation to supply\nmaintenance between persons related by affinity in the direct line is imposed by the law\n(Art.198 of RFC). In contradistinction to marriage, as provided in Art.100 of the RFC in irregular union, a\nbond of affinity is created neither between the man and the relatives of the woman nor\nbetween the woman and the relatives of the man. However, sub-article 2 of the above\narticle provides that the legal impediments to a lawful marriage in the case of affinity are\napplicable to it. Accordingly, by virtue of Art.9 of the RFC marriage between persons\nrelated by irregular union in the direct line is prohibited. In the collateral line, marriage\nbetween a man and the sister of his partner in an irregular union and the brother of her\npartner is prohibited. Because Art.19 of the Amhara Family Law is the verbatim copy of\nthe RFC, what has been said in relation to the latter explains the former. However, since degrees of impediment to marriage in Oromiya and Tigray, for instance,\nare different from the RFC, irregular union as an impediment to marriage should be seen\naccordingly. ( Read Art.28 of the Oromiya family law and Arts.3-5 of Tigray Family\nCode).",

    "text": "When it is broadly interpreted, it may also be said that the woman cannot engage\nin an irregular union with a man who is the relative of the man with whom she had been\npreviously engaged in such union. But is it not contradictory, as far as the law is\nconcerned, to say that there is no bond of affinity in irregular union on the one hand and\nprohibit marriage between the man and the relative of the woman or marriage between\nthe woman and the relatives of the man on the other hand? Obviously, there is a clear\ncontradiction. However, despite this contradiction the prohibition is justified on the\nground of policy considerations. The prohibition is justified so long as it is done in the\ninterest of protecting and maintaining the good relations between relatives and also\nmaintaining peace and order in society. One can imagine the attendant chaos if a man is\nallowed by the law to marry the sister of the woman with whom he had been previously\nengaged in irregular union leaving her aside. The same crisis arises if the woman does so. Hence, in the light of such complicated problems, the prohibition is justified. (C) Duty to Contribute to the Common Expenses\nIt has been discussed under effects of marriage that couples in a marriage are duty bound\nto contribute to the household expenses in proportion to their ability and respective\nmeans. Similarly, the man and the woman in irregular union are obliged to contribute to\nthe common expenses they may incur during their union in proportion to their respective\nmeans (Art.101 of RFC). If both the man and the woman have similar means, the\ncommon expense is shouldered equally by both parties. If, however, one of the parties is\nunemployed and without means, he/she is not required to contribute any thing. In this\ncase, the duty is to be assumed only by the other. Expenses incurred for the benefit of\neither of the parties are not considered as common expenses even if it is done during the\nunion. Common expense is one which is done for the interest of the partners in the union. What are such as expenses? (D) Community Property\nBecause the 1960 Civil Code did not create community property in irregular union,\npartners irregular of union did not historically enjoy the same property rights as spouses\nof lawful marriage.",

    "text": "The law, by its refusal to recognize the creation of community\nproperty in such union, seriously handicapped judges in their ability to relieve the\ninequity and hardships to one of the parties and prevent unjust enrichment of either of the\nparties. A woman may engage in irregular union assuming that some legal protections are\navailable to her relationship with the man or without any ideas as to the legal\nconsequences of her relationship, or may be with the assumption that no legal distinction\nis made between her relationship and that of marriage. ( See C.C Bruch “Property Rights\nof De facto Spouses Including Thoughts on the Value of Home Maker’s services; Family\nLaw Quarterly, Vol.10, No 1-4 (1978) p.135). During such union, common property may\nbe created through the effort of the man and the woman. However, after a certain period,\nthis relationship may be terminated for one reason or another. In this case, woman was\nevicted from the house by the man without any share of property. In such situations, the\nman could acquire wealth by unduly exploiting the woman. In order to understand the injustices caused to parties in an irregular union, the following\ntwo Ethiopian court cases are presented. In one case, a certain Beletu Achame brought suit against a man named Ato Gebresadik\nWorkneh in the former Addis Ababa Awraja Court alleging that she and the defendant\nwere married since 1964 E.C and had five children from their relationship. Despite that\nhe forced her out of the conjugal home. She requested the court to make an order of\nmaintenance for her and refer the case to family arbitrators. However, the defendant\ndenied the existence of marriage. She proved that she was registered as the defendant’s\nwife in “Edir”, kebele family form and pension forms. Besides, four witnesses testified\nthat the two parties lived in the defendant’s house as husband and wife but did not know\nwhether marriage was concluded or not. Based on this evidence, the Awaraja court\ndecided that there was marriage. Because of this, the defendant appealed to the then High\nCourt stating that the decision of the Awraja court was not appropriate. The High Court\nreversed the decision of the Awraja court by reasoning that the fact that there was a valid\nmarriage was not proved. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the High Court. Hence, the woman could not share from the community property\nAnother case involving a substantial amount of property was the case of Ato Arusi\nKetema and W/ro Zewde Yigletu.",

He added that during the marriage, she took some money\nfrom the common property and opened a “tej bet” in Melka Jebdu (Harar); they had a bar,\na pension and “tej bet” in Melka Belo “Haretecha” Town. He requested the court so that\norder would be given for the coming back of the woman to the conjugal home with the\nproperty she took. She was summoned but did not appear. Then based on the testimony\nof witnesses, who testified that the two persons lived together as husband and wife, the\ncourt handed down an ex parte judgment that there was marriage and referred the case to\nfamily arbitrators. The defendant appealed to the High Court of Eastern Hararghe\nAdministrative Region stating that there was no marriage but irregular union and that she\nterminated the union because of health reasons. She also said that there was no common\nproperty. The High Court reversed the decision of the court of rendition and reasoned that\nthe testimony of the witness demonstrated that the relationship was an irregular union and\nthe property acquired in an irregular union belonged to the one who acquired it. ( Ato\nArusi Ketema Vs. W/ro Zewde Yigletu, (Sup. Ct. 1986, Civ. App. No 47/86,\nunpublished). This means that no property was given to the man. Bear in mind that the parties lived together for about thirty-six years, but all property was\nregistered in her name and the man finally found himself without any share from the\nproperty acquired during their relationship. From the above two cases, you can understand that although the woman lived for many\nyears with the man, property should not be shared since under the 1960 Civil Code\nirregular union could not create community property. It was upon termination of the union that the man might be ordered to pay to the woman\nan indemnity corresponding to not more than three months allowance by virtue of\nArts.716 cum 717 of the Civil Code. This was done if and only if the judge felt that\nequity requires so. If the judge felt otherwise, the woman was not entitled to any\nindemnity and had to leave her house surrendering the common popery to the man.

    "text": "Under the current family laws, irregular union has been made to give rise to\ncommunity property between the cohabitees provided the relationship lasts for three\nyears or more. All properties that the man and the woman have acquired during their\nunion are considered to have been acquired within the union and, therefore, are presumed\nto be common property of the man and woman although the presumption is a reputable\none. ( See Art 102 of the RFC and relevant provisions of the regional family laws). Cohabitants in irregular union cannot agree that no community property is created during\ntheir union. This is against public policy. The law has its own policy reasons behind the\ncreation of community property. The man and the woman, however, are at liberty to\nagree as to the administration of the common property. As explained above, community property is created when the union of the man and the\nwoman lasts for not less than three years. A union lasting less than three yeas, therefore,\ndoes not create common property and the parties can terminate the union without any\ndispute relating to common property. If, however, the one who terminated the union\ncommits a fault, he/she is liable to pay damages. This can be assessed in accordance with\nthe relevant provisions of the Ethiopian extra-contractual liability law (see Art.2090-2123\nof the Civil Code). When we come to effects of community property, community property gives rise to\nissues such as administration and liquidation of the common property. In this regard, the\nRFC, under Article 103, has stipulated that matters relating to the administration and\nliquidation as well as payment of debts in case of irregular union are to be governed in\naccordance with the provisions of the code that deal with community property and\nliquidation of pecuniary relations of spouses in marriage. ( Hence it is important to relate\nthis discussion with the discussions previously made under the foregoing chapter). As matter of principle, the common property of the man and the woman in an irregular\nunion is administered jointly with a view to ensuring equality of sex which is\nunequivocally guaranteed under the FDRE Constitution. Nonetheless, the above rule will\nnot be applicable where it is agreed by the partners that one of them administer the whole\njointly owned property or just a part of it. Nor is it applicable where one of the partners is\ndeclared incapable, deprived of his/her right of property management or incapable of\nadministering the common property for any other valid reasons.",

All actions for sale, exchange, rent out, pledge, mortgage or alienation in any other way\nof the common property need the consent of both the man and the woman in the union. The same consent is also required for similar actions in relation to a common movable\nproperty and securities registered in the name of both partners the value of which exceeds\n500 Birr. Neither the partners are allowed to borrow or lend money exceeding the above\namount of money or stand surety for a debt of 500 Birr; nor is it possible for them to\ntransfer a common property the value of which is greater than 100 Birr or money greater\nthan such sum by way of donation lacking common consent.

Non-observance of the above rules by one of the partners gives the other partner the right\nto bring an action for the cancellation of the obligations entered within six months after\nhe/she became aware of the creation of such obligations or in any case within two years\nafter such obligations have been entered.

In this regard, it has been provided that the division of\nthe common property in irregular union will be effected in accordance with the\nagreement entered into for this purpose by the parties. In default of such agreement which\nis usually the case between partners in such union, it is the provisions of the law on\nliquidation of pecuniary relation of spouses in marriage that apply to the division of the\njointly owned property of cohabitants (Read Art.103 of the RFC with Arts 85-93 of the\nsame code and the respective provisions of regional family laws). Before establishing the share of the man and the woman in the common property, there\nare certain procedures that have to be complied with.",

They have to prove this fact because, unless proved, it will be taken as common\nproperty as per article 102(2) and hence no right of retaking. According to this article,\nany property which exists during the union is deemed to have been acquired within the\nunion and hence constitutes common property unless it is proved to the contrary. Hence,\na cohabitee can take back his property by proving that such property belonged to him/her. Secondly, where the personal property of a cohabitee has been alienated and its price has\nfallen into the common property, he/she is entitled to recover it from the common\nproperty (Art.103 can Art.86(2)). A cohabitee is also entitled to indemnify if it is found\nout that the personal property of the other or the common property has been enriched to\nthe prejudice of his property (Art.103 can Art.86). Damages may also be demanded\nbefore the physical division of the common property takes place by either of the\ncohabitants where the other partner, having been empowered to administer the jointly\nowned property, performs acts which adversely affect his/her partner or such acts are\ndone without mandate, or constitute acts of bad administration or have been performed in\nfraud of the right of the partner making the claim (Id, Art.103 cum Art.87). In such cases,\nthe aggrieved partner can not request the court to grant him damage if the above acts\noccur five years before the termination of the union. Debts of the cohabitants have to be\nalso paid before the partition of the common property (Id, Art.103 cum Art.89) which is\nmeant to protect creditors who may be in a disadvantageous position if partition is made\nbefore their claims are settled. As mentioned before, partition has to be done only after all the procedures discussed\nabove (i.e., retaking, withdrawal, indemnity, and payment of debts) have been completed. Once this has been done, the common property will be divided equally between the\ncohabitees. Equal partition is realized, however, only on condition that no contrary\nagreement exists between the cohabitants. It is true that the manner of division can be\ndetermined by the cohabitants themselves where they conclude a division contract. As a\nrule, partition takes place in kind in such a way that each cohabitee takes some property\nfrom the common property.",

    "text": "Where it is impossible to divide the jointly owned property\nequally, the inequality in kind should be compensated by payment of money. It should be\nnoted that things which are most useful to a cohabitant should as far as possible be\nassigned to his/her share. For instance, if a certain property is relevant to the business or\noccupation of a cohabitant, it should be give to him/her. It may happen that a certain\nproperty is difficult or impossible to be divided because, for instance, the property in\nquestion cannot be taken apart by its nature or taking it apart would prevent its\nfunctioning or devalue it and the partners may not be in accord as to who will have this\nproperty. In this case, the property is sold and the money received is shared by the\npartners. In default of agreement on the condition of sale, the property will be sold by\nauction (Read Arts. 103 can Arts.85-93 of the RFC). (E) Debts of the Man and the Woman in Irregular Union\nDuring the union, the man and the woman may transact with third parties and incur debts. Such debts may be incurred either for the interest of both parties or for personal purposes. If a debt is incurred either by the man or the woman for their maintenance and their\nchildren, it becomes a common debt and creditors will have a recourse against one or\nboth (Read Art.102(3) of the RFC). In other words, such debts may be recovered from the\npersonal property of each cohabitee and/or from the common property. Under Art. 714 of\nthe Civil Code, it was provided that if a debt was contracted by the man for the\nmaintenance of the children and of the woman and the man, the woman would not be\nheld jointly and severally liable with the man. If, however, it is the woman who\ncontracted the debt, the man would be held jointly and severally liable with the woman. Obviously, the RFC and regional family laws have not drawn such distinctions. What do\nyou think is the retainable behind this? Would it undermine equality of sex if the\narticle were retained under the new family laws? If a common debt of the man and the woman is due after the termination of the union and\nthe division of the common property, each of them is liable to pay the debt in proportion\nto his or her share (RFC, AA.103 cum Art.93).",

Under the Civil Code since no community property exists between unmarried\ncohabitants, such right of recourse by the creditors against the common property was\nabsent. (F) Filiation\nThe other issue that is intertwined with irregular union is the issue of filiation. Because\nfiliation is to be given a wide coverage in chapter seven of this course material, it suffices\nto say that a child conceived or born of an irregular union has as his father the man\nengaged in such union. This was the case under the Civil Code since Art.715 provides\nthat filiations of the children born of an irregular union shall be established in accordance\nwith the relevant provisions of the code and Art.745 of the same code stipulates that a\nchild conceived or born during an irregular union has a father the man engaged in such\nunion. The same thing has been reiterated in the RFC and the regional family laws. As to\nthe details, we refer you to the discussions made under the next chapter. 6.7. Proof of Irregular Union\nFrom the discussion under chapter four, you have seen that there is no presumption that\npersons are married and hence a party asserting the existence of marriage is required to\nadduce proof to it. Similarly, a party desiring to benefit from the legal consequences of an\nirregular union is also required to prove the existence of irregular union, when such union\nis provide in accordance with the requirements of the law, the legal effects of such union\nbecome operative. As this juncture, you can understand that marriage may be proved by various modes of\nproof typical among which particularly in Ethiopia are certificates of marriage and\npossession of status. When it comes to proof of irregular union, the primary and frequent mode of poof is\npossession of status as opposed to documentary evidence. This type of mode of proof is\npreferred because of its practical significance. Most frequently, a man and woman engage\nin an irregular union without a written agreement that evidences the fact of their union. It\nis a simple union in which it is hard to find a reliable documentary evidence to prove the\nfact of the union. But the issue worth raising is as to what is meant by possession of status?",

    "text": "Possession of\nstatus is said to have comprised some three facts known as “nomen”, “tractus”, and\n“fama”. “ Nomen” is the fact of having the name which indicates the status; “tractus” is\nthe fact of being generally reputed as having the status by all persons with whom family\nor business relations took place; and “fama” is the fact of being generally recognized and\ntreated by the public as having the status. It is the addition of all these three facts that\ngive rise to possession of status (M. Planiol and G. Report, Treatise on the Civil Law,\n(12th ed; 1939, Vol.1, part 1, 959 p.278). Hence, brearing in mind the aforementioned facts, possession of status may be\nunderstood as the fact of bearing the name that designates the status and being treated and\nrecognized as having such status by the community in general and by family members,\nfriends and other acquaintances in particular. Despite this, however, proof of irregular union by possession of status is not an easy task. The 1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia provided for two modes of proof by which the existence\nof irregular union may be established. These are proof by possession of status and proof\nby an act of notoriety (Read Art.718 of the Civil Code). However, proof of union using\nsuch modes of proof was problematic in the past due to lack of clarity on the part of the\nlaw. As regards proof by possession of status, the problem with this mode of proof is its\nconfusion with proof of marriage by possession of status. Some judges interpreted\nArt.699 of the Civil Code which deals with proof of marriage by possession of status in\nthe same a way as proof of irregular union by possession of status. According to these\njudges, if witnesses are able to prove the fact that the man and the woman lived as\nhusband and wife and as a result of this, the witnesses themselves and other persons in\nthe community could recognize them as such this by itself would suffice to prove\nmarriage. Other judges, however, took a different position in relation to the above issue. They said that when marriage was to be proved by possession of status, the witnesses\nshould testify the fact of the celebration of the marriage some time in the past in addition\nto those facts clearly provided under Art.699.",

    "text": "According to this line of interpretation, the\nwitnesses, in addition to testifying that the man and the woman behaved as spouses and\nas a result of this, their families and society consider them as such, has to testify they\nhave witnessed the celebration of the marriage some time in the past. Unless we interpret\nit this way, they said, no distinction will be made between proof by possession of status\nin case of marriage and irregular union (Hig Ena Fitih, Journal of Law of the Federal\nSupreme Courts, Nehasie, 1981 E.C, p.22). Having in mind the above two differing views and in response to the lack of uniformity\nwith regard to the practice of courts in interpreting possession of status in marriage, the\nPlenum of the Supreme Court issued a directive that favored the second line of\ninterpretation in accordance with the power given to it by article 22(2) of proc. No.9/1980. The directive under Art. 3 provided that proof of marriage by a possession of\nstatus should be understood as a mode of proof that establishes the fact of the celebration\nof the marriage in any of the three forms of marriage (i.e., civil, religious and customary). It stated that taking proof of marriage by possession of status as identical with that of\nproof of irregular union by possession of status will have the effect of uniting by\nmarriage those who were not married and considering as unmarried those who were\nmarried. Hence, to avoid such unpleasant consequences, courts should make sure that\nwitnesses have testified proving the celebration of the marriage as an additional\nrequirement to Art.699 of the Civil Code. The problem of proof relating to possession of status and the lack of uniformity of\njudgments by courts in this regard was thus solved as discussed above by the issuance of\nthe directive. The other problem relating to proof of irregular union under the Civil Code is that which\npertains to act of notoriety. The Civil Code under article 720 states that the existence of\nirregular union might be proved by an act of notoriety when possession of status is\ncontested. It further provides that the provisions of the Civil Code pertaining to proof of\nmarriage by an act of notoriety (Art.702-706) are applicable to proof of irregular union. However, the problem with Art.720 is that proof of irregular union by an act of notoriety\nis impossible and incompatible with the very concept of irregular union (G.\nKrzeczunowicz, Problems in Ethiopian Family Law 1978, problem 18).",

Such authorization is made by the court when, for instance, the registers\nof marriage have not been regularly kept or where it is impossible to the claimant to\nobtain the copy of the record in the register of marriage (Id, Art.703(a) –Art.147(1)). Such provisions of the law point to the prior celebration of marriage in either of the three\nforms of marriage and hence irrelevant to irregular union which actually does not result\nfrom a prior celebration. What is more, proof by an act of notoriety is governed by\nArt.146-153 of the Civil Code and as per Art.149 of this code, an act of notoriety is to be\ndrawn having the same particulars as a record of marriage would. Evidently, a record of\nmarriage, among other things, is required to show the date of celebration of the marriage\n(Id, Art.117(c)). This obviously is inconsistent with the state of fact definition of irregular\nunion despite the fact that it is made applicable on irregular union by virtue of Art.720(2)\nof the Civil Code. To sum up, the provisions of the code (i.e., Arts.701-706) that deal with proof of\nmarriage by an act of notoriety which were made applicable to proof of irregular union\nby article 720(2) are totally incompatible with the concept of irregular union to which no\nprior recording, registration and celebration is required. Proof of irregular union by an act of notoriety is also impossible on another ground\ndifferent from the above. It is true that an act of notoriety is prepared by an officer of\ncivil status or notaries (Id, Art 146(1)). The task of drawing up an act of notoriety is\ngiven solely to officers of civil status or notaries, not to any other organs. However, such\noffices have not been established in Ethiopia and hence proof by act of notoriety in case\nof irregular union was impossible. How about the RFC and the regional family laws? Have the new family laws solved\nthe problem of proof of irregular union? The RFC and the regional family laws have adopted a single mode of proof by which an\nirregular union may be proved. They have singled out possession of status as a mode of\nproof of irregular union by ignoring proof by an act of notoriety.",

    "text": "Thus, the problem\nrelating to proof by an act of notoriety is no more a problem of proof of irregular union\nunder the RFC for this mode of proof by itself was struck out from the ambit of proof of\nirregular union as unnecessary. As mentioned in the foregoing discussions, possession of status is a concept that\nencompasses the fact of bearing the name that designated the status and the fact of being\ntreated and recognized as having the status by relatives, friends and acquaintances in\nparticular and the society in general. The RFC under article 106, provides that irregular union is to be proved by way of\npossession of status and defined possession of status of persons living in an irregular\nunion as the state of affairs in which the man and the woman, though not married, behave\nas married people and as a result of this, they are recognized as such by their families and\nthe community as well. As can be understood from the definition, three facts have to be proved to constitute\npossession of status of persons living in an irregular union. These are (a) the fact that the\nman and the woman behaved as married people (b) That they are considered as married\npeople by their families and (c) The fact that both are considered as married persons by\nthe community. In the first place, the witnesses called upon to prove the possession of status of persons\nliving in an irregular union have to testify that the persons behaved like married people. They have to testify that the man and the woman conducted themselves and lived\ntogether like married people sharing the same house and exchanging love, loyalty and\nrespect to each other. They must show to the court that the man and the woman perform\nacts which are analogous to those acts which are usually done by married couples. Secondly, to constitute possession of status in case of irregular union, the witnesses are\nexpected to show that the man and the woman are recognized and treated as married by\ntheir families and relatives. Being recognized as married by one of the families of the\npartners only is not sufficient to prove the possession of status of persons living in an\nirregular union. The fact that both the families and relatives of the man and the woman\nrecognize the partners as married should be proved by the witnesses. This may be\naccomplished, for instance, when the witnesses testify they have seen the families of the\npartners visit them during holidays and in times of problem. (",

Finally, the witnesses should convince the court that an irregular union existed between\nthe partners by showing that the parties lived together so openly like husband and wife\nthat the community within which they live recognize and treat them as married. They\nhave to be able to establish the fact that their neighborhood, acquaintances and other\npersons who come into contact with the man and the woman consider them as married\npeople. You need to bear in mind that the witnesses have to make it clear that the opinion\nof the community towards the relationship of the man and the woman is undivided and\nuniform. If there is a division of opinion in the community towards the relationship of the\nman and the woman, they will not be considered to have acquired the possession of status\nof persons living in an irregular union. ( Ibid)\nUnder the current family laws of Ethiopia, proof by certificate of marriage is the primary\nmode of proof. However, proof by certificate of marriage is difficult, it may be proved by\npossession of status. ( See Art.95 of the RFC). According to Art.96 of RFC, possession of\nstatus of spouses is established when the man and the woman mutually consider\nthemselves and live as married and as a result of this, they are considered and treated as\nspouses by their families and the community as a whole. As far as the law is concerned, possession of status of spouses is distinguished from\npossession of status of persons living in an irregular union in two ways. The first\ndistinctive feature is that in the case of possession of status of persons living in an\nirregular union, it is not a requirement that the man and the woman should mutually\nconsider and treat each other as husband and wife. Therefore, the witnesses called upon\nto prove the state of fact of irregular union are not required to prove the fact that the\nparties have lived together mutually considering themselves as married people. However,\nthis is a requirement when it comes to possession of status of spouses. The fact that the\nman and the woman mutually consider themselves as married should be proved to\nestablish possession of status of spouses. This distinguishing factor, however, is not that\nimportant practically. This distinction is present even under the Civil Code but it did not\nserve its purpose for it has no practical significance (Hig Ena Fitih).",

    "text": "This is because,\nmostly the circumstances under which a man and woman introduce themselves to third\nparties that they are husband and wife are rare particularly in our society. Unless they are\nasked so or other situations dictate them, usually a man and woman do not explainto the\ncommunity that they are married. The reality on the ground is that the people around\nthem consider and recognize them as married by simple consideration of their behavior\ntowards one another and in consideration of their joint life. The chance of overhearing the\nparties that they consider themselves as husband and wife is very much rare. Therefore,\nthis distinction is a distinction that exists as far as the law is concerned. It does not serve\nits purpose to a layman witness who testifies on the basis of the overt conduct of the\nparties. Though not specifically provided as in the case of the first distinctive feature, the second\ndistinctive feature is one that which is capable of creating a real dichotomy between the\ntwo concepts (i.e., possession of status of spouses and possession of status of persons\nliving in an irregular union) which, as discussed before, were a subject of debate prior to\nthe coming into force of the current family laws of Ethiopia. It is to be recalled that under\nthe Civil Code because of the lack of clarity on the part of the law, it was difficult to\nknow the intention of the legislature regarding the interpretation of possession of status of\nspouses and as a result of this, some judges took possession of status of spouses as\nidentical with possession of status of persons living in an irregular union while others\ntreated the two concepts differently.

With a view to\navoiding the above confusion, the RFC has given a clue by which the intention of the\nlegislature may be known for interpreting possession of status of spouses (Ibid). Even\nthought it is not clear from the English version of the title of Chapter Six of the RFC\nwhich is entitled “proof of marriage” in the same way as the Civil Code, the title of the\nAmharic version of this chapter gives a clue about the intention of the legislature in\nrelation to the meaning of possession of status of spouses (Ibid). chapter six of the\nAmharic Version of the RFC is entitled «UBÒ lmfiÑ Sl¸qRB ¥Sr©´.",

Hence, as it can be understood\nfrom the title given to proof of marriage by the Amharic version of the RFC which is the\nofficial version, any mode of proof (including possession of status) of marriage\nwhatsoever should prove, inter alia, the fact that the marriage had been celebrated\n(concluded) in either of the three forms of marriage sometime in the past. Accordingly, proof of marriage by possession of status of spouses is not limited to\nestablishing the fact that the man and the woman mutually consider themselves as\nmarried and as a result of this, their families as well as the community consider and treat\nthem as spouses as stipulated by Article 96 of the RFC. The fact of the celebration of the\nmarriage in one of the forms of marriage (i.e., civil, religious or customary) should also\nbe proved as an additional requirement of Article 96 of the RFC. This additional\nrequirement obviously distinguishes proof of marriage by possession of status of spouses\nand proof of irregular union by possession of status of persons living in an irregular union\nfor what has to be proved in case of irregular union is that the man and the woman\nbehaved as married people and are regarded as such by their families and the community. Nothing more is required. The problem with this additional requirement, however, is that\nit is totally absent in the English version and also that it is not specifically and clearly\nprovided in the Amharic version. As shown above, it is by way of interpretation that one\ncan arrive at the additional requirement that the fact of the celebration of marriage has to\nbe proved to establish possession of status of spouses. Hence, it is very difficult to say\nthat the RFC and other regional family codes have effectively and successfully avoided\nthe confusion with regard to possession of status for they have failed to provide for the\nadditional requirement that has been discussed above. Because of the absence of a clear and specific provisions, courts might not consider the\nfact of the celebration of the marriage as an element in establishing possession of status\nof spouses.",

    "text": "For instance, in the case of W/o Assebech Wolde Tsadic V W/o Timnit\nGebreab, the Region 14 Administrative Zone Court decided that W/o Assebech is not the\nwife of the late Ato Gebreab since the witnesses did not testify that they had known and\nseen the celebration of the marriage between W/o Assebech and Ato Gebreab. W/o\nAssebech appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Zone Court. The\nSupreme Court reversed the decision of the Zone Court and ruled that, even though the\nwitnesses did not know about the celebration of the marriage, the testimony of witnesses\nthat they as well as the families, relatives and the community know and recognize W/o\nAssebech and the late Ato Gebreab live as husband and wife and the register of ‘Idir”\nmembers and the ‘kebele’ residents form produced by the appellant which confirms the\ntestimony of the witnesses are sufficient to establish possession of status of spouses in the\nlight of the requirements of Article 95 and 96 of the RFC. Assuming that W/o Tminit\nGebreab brought her case to the cassation division of the Federal Supreme Court\nalleging that the decision of the Federal Supreme Court contained fundamental erro\nof law, how would you go about the case? In another the case, W/o Muna Zeinu V W/o Seble Demeke, the court, however,\nconsidered the fact of the celebration of the marriage as an element in proving possession\nof status of spouses. In this case, the witnesses testified that W/o Muna and the late Ato\nSamuel Mamo had celebrated their marriage in accordance with their custom. Moreover,\nthey testified that W/o Muna and Ato Samuel lived as husband and wife and that the late\nAto Samuel had at one time introduced W/o Muna to his families as his wife. Taking into\nconsideration the afore-mentioned remarks made by the witnesses, the court ruled that the\ntestimony of the witnesses in the case at hand established the status of spouses as per\nArticles 95 and 96 of the RFC (Yeka First Instance Court, 1995 Civil case No 00086/95). As you can understand from the above two cases, there is still a possibility for\ninconsistency in interpreting possession of status of spouses which is attributable to the\nabsence of a clear and specific provision that demands the fact of the celebration of the\nmarriage be proved to establish possession of status of spouses.",

    "text": "Coming to the effect of proof of irregular union, if the fact that the man and the woman\nhave openly cohabited as husband and wife and behaved as married people and as a result\nof this, their families and the community recognize and treated them as such is proved to\nthe satisfaction of the court, this by itself gives rise to a presumption that the man and the\nwoman had previously engaged in an irregular union ((Art.106(3) of the RFC). Upon\nproof of the above facts, the law presumes that the man and the woman lived in an\nirregular union and the legal effects that naturally flow from this union will be enjoyed by\nthe party asserting its existence. Under such circumstances, the burden of showing that an\nirregular union did not exist lies on those who so asserting. That is, the presumption is not\nconclusive and, therefore, can be rebutted by a contrary proof (Art.106 (4) of the RFC. Before we conclude this section, few points need to be raised as regards the manner of\nestablishing possession of status in the case of irregular union. It is true that proof is the\nact of persuading the mind of the judge by showing evidence or the reality of a fact\nalleged. The parties have to be able to establish a requisite degree of belief concerning a\nfact in the mind of the tries of a fact or the court by way of proof. This act of persuading\nthe judge or the court is usually accomplished through the aid of witnesses, documents,\nadmissions and declarations. Similarly, possession of status is the mode of proof of irregular union. Using the mode of\nproof of possession of status, parties are at liberty to persuade the court that an irregular\nunion exists. But, how is possession of status of established? In other words, what is the\nmanner of establishing possession of status of persons living in an irregular union? Under\nthe Civil Code of Ethiopia, the manner of establishing such possession of status seems to\nbe limited to testimony of witness and no other way of establishing possession of status\nsince Art.719 of the Civil Code provides that possession of status shall be proved by\nproducing reliable witnesses and it may be contested by producing reliable witnesses. Such limitations are not made under the RFC, Article 106(4) of the RFC has provided\nthat the presumption of the existence of irregular union “may be rebutted by producing\nany kind of reliable proof”.",

    "text": "Oversely, it may be that the possession of status of persons\nliving in an irregular union is established by producing any kind of reliable proof. So long\nas the proof is reliable, possession of status may be established through the aid of\nwitnesses and documentary evidence. But, what is reliable proof (evidence)? In the case\nW/o Muna Zeinu V W/o Sebel Demeke the court reasoned that even though a contract of\nmarriage does not prove the existence of marriage, the testimony of witnesses who were\nmentioned as witness in the contract of marriage is a reliable proof to prove the existence\nof marriage by possession of status. The fact of the presence of their name in the contract\nof marriage makes the testimony of the witnesses reliable. Similarly, the testimony of the\nman who once upon a time reconciled the man and the woman while they were living in\nan irregular union and whose name had been mentioned as arbitrator in the document\ndetailing the arbitration of the two parties may be taken as reliable proof. It should be\nnoted that the code uses the same language which is “reliable proof (evidence)” when the\npresumption of the existence of irregular union and marriage are to be contested (Read\nArt.97 (2) cum Art.106 (4) of the RFC). Furthermore, some documents that create a certain degree of belief like “kebele”\nresidents register and members of “Idir” register that recorded the man and the woman as\nhusband and wife are important to prove the existence of irregular union. This is because\nthe kebele residents as well as members of the “Idir” will regard the man and the woman\nas married in consideration of such registers. Even though such kinds of documentary\nevidence may not independently prove the possession of status of persons living in an\nirregular union, it is advisable to admit them in evidence to corroborate testimony of\nwitnesses and other documentary evidence. 6.8. Termination of Union\nOne of the distinguishing features of irregular union is its easy termination. The parties in\nthe union may unilaterally or by mutual consent end the union. Irregular union is also\nterminated on the death of either of the parties and in some jurisdictions by de facto\nseparation of the parties for over a year or when either of them get married with a third\nparty (G.C. Cantero, “The Catalan Family Code of 1998 and other Autonomous Regional\nLaws on de facto unions, “The International Survey of Family Law (2000.ed) p.400.",

    "text": "As we have seen above, the unilateral will of either of the parties in irregular union\nsuffices to end it and this actually makes the legal force of the union a loose one. However, the termination gives rise to certain juridical consequences. The end of the\nunion does not totally cause the cessation of all effects. Some effects do in fact subsist\nafter the cessation of the union. ( Ibid)\nIn Ethiopia, the man and the woman are at liberty to end their union at any time they\nwish. Accordingly, an irregular may be terminated unilaterally or by mutual consent in\naddition to the clear instance of termination of the union by death. Though not clearly\nprovided, an irregular union may also be dissolved by a court order when a man and\nwoman previously engaged in an irregular union beginto live in an irregular union with\nthe sister or brother of one another upon the application of any interested person or the\npublic prosecutor (Read for instance Art.32 cum Art.100(2) of the RFC). It is worth\nnoting that a man or woman who were previously engaged in an irregular union cannot\nmarry or live in an irregular union with the brother or sister of the other as it is prohibited\nunder Art.100(2) of the RFC. This legal effect of irregular union subsists even after the\nbreak up of the parties. As mentioned before, under the Civil Code when an irregular union is terminated\nunilaterally by the woman, there is no obligation on the part of the woman to pay\nindemnity to the man for doing so. However, if it was the man that terminated the union\nunilaterally, he might be held liable to pay indemnity to the woman. Under the RFC and\nother regional Family Codes, however, no such obligation to pay indemnity is imposed\nexclusively on the man. For instance, according to Art.105 (2), of the RFC unless the\nparty that ended the union commits a fault, no obligation to pay damages is imposed by\nthe law. The other effect of termination of irregular union is that of the division of the common\nproperty if there is any. As has been said previously, if the union lasts for three years, the\nlaw presumes that property acquired during the union is a common property. Hence,\nwhen the union is ended either through the initiation of the man or the woman or by\nmutual consent, the fact of the termination results in the division of the jointly owned\nproperty between the parties.",

    "text": "If the death of a party ends an irregular union, the surviving partner is not entitled to\ninherit the property of the deceased unless the deceased provided for this right by way of\na will in accordance with the rules of testate succession. All what the survivor gets is\nwhat is provided for him or her in the will of the deceased partner if there is any. It is to\nbe noted that no right of succession exists even between spouses in a lawful marriage. Hence, termination of union by death results in partition of the common property between\nthe surviving partner and a person considered as the deceased’s heir by law. 6.9. Summary\nMen and women establish various intimate relationships. Among such relationships,\nmarriage is the typical one. However, men and women live together in an irregular union\nfor various reasons. The causes that may make man and a woman to live together without\nconcluding formal marriage may be economic, social and other reasons. Because family is established under such union, the law should give recognition to such\nunion with a view to protecting such family, particularly the rights of children born from\nthis union and the rights of women with respect to their right to equality with men. That\nis why,  Ethiopian family laws, both the federal family law and  regional family laws,\nhave given recognition and protection to irregular union although the  protection\naccorded  to partners  in an irregular union is not equal  to protections given to spouses\nin marriage. In Ethiopia, irregular union produces certain legal effects. The first thing is that it creates\ncommunity property so long as the parties have lived together for not less than three\nyears. Secondly, partners are duty bound to contribute to the common expenses of the\nfamily in accordance with their means. Thirdly, if the parties   entered into transactions\nand are indebted to third parties in the interest of the family, they are duty bound to\ndischarge such debt according to the law. The other most important effect of irregular\nunion is the fact that a child conceived or born in this union is deemed to be the child of\nthe man who was with the women during conception or birth of such child. Irregular union in Ethiopia is quite different from marriage in many respects. One\ndifference is that irregular union is proved by possession of status while marriage is\nproved by record of marriage and possession of status.",

    "text": "Even in the case of possession of\nstatus, proof of irregular union by possession of status is not similar to proof of marriage\nby possession of status. Irregular union is freely formed by the parties without following the rigorous procedures\nof marriage. Similarly, it can be terminated by one of the partners without any reason\nalthough a partner who ended the union by committing fault is required to pay\ncompensation to the other partner. 6.10. Review Questions\n1. Discuss the differences between marriage and irregular union focusing on:\n(a) Procedures of formation and termination. (b) Personal and pecuniary effects. 2. It is clear that all the Family Codes of Ethiopia have given recognition and protection\nto irregular union although the effects attached to irregular union are not the same as\nmarriage. Would it be necessary to upgrade irregular union to the status of marriage? Why? Why not? 3. During the adoption of the Revised Family Code of the FDRE, there were serious\ndebates as regards the status of irregular union. A group seriously argued that\nirregular union should be done away with. The other group vehemently counter-\nargued that maintaining irregular union was meant to address social problems already\non the ground. Despite such arguments, the Ethiopian family laws have given\nrecognition to irregular union. Assume, however, that the same debate has recurred in\nEthiopia. To which of the above arguments do you subscribe? Why? Why not? 4. Read closely the provisions of the 1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia (Arts.708-721) and\nArts.98-107 of the Revised Family Code of FDRE or the relevant articles of any\nRegional Family Code and identify the departures made by the New Family Codes as\ncompared to the provisions of the Civil Code. Discuss the rationale behind such\ndepartures in view of equality of men and women incorporated under the FDRE\nConstitution and other international human right instruments to which Ethiopia is a\nparty. 5. If you closely read Arts.98-107 of the RFC, Arts.109-118 of the Amhara Family Code,\nArts.128-139 Oromiya Family Code and Arts.120-130 of the Family Code of Tigray,\nyou can understand that all the articles are one and the same. Are there any common\ncultural, religious and social grounds particularly in the three regions so as to come\nup with the same legal provisions on irregular union? How would you evaluate this in\nthe light the fact that Ethiopia is a multi-cultural society and it has adopted an ethnic-\nbased federation? 6.",

Could personal and pecuniary effects of irregular union be\nregulated by contractual agreements made by the partners to such union? 8.

Why? Why  not? CHAPTER SEVEN\nFILIATION\n7.1. Introduction\nThis chapter of the course discusses filiation which is the most sensitive part of the\nfamily law. It is the most sensitive because it is under this part that an issue pertaining to\nchild parent relationship is determined by law. Of course, for the time being, determining\nmaterial filiation is not as difficult as paternal filiation. Determining paternal filiation is\ndifficult because it is not easy to exactly know who the biological father of the child is. Hence, the law has provided certain important modes of establishment of paternity. It is\nthese modes which will be discussed under this chapter to the extent possible. Because\nthese modes are very much relevant particularly from the view point of the right of the\nchild, due attention has been given to them. The chapter also discusses how filiation is\nproved and challenged. One thing that we want to remind you at this juncture is that because the regional family\ncodes have made no departure from the provisions of the Revised Family Code of\nEthiopia regarding filiation, for purpose of convenience, and to avoid unnecessary\nduplication of legal provisions, the provisions of the Revised Family Code (The RFC\nhereinafter) have been used throughout this chapter. 7.2. Objectives\nUpon the completion of this chapter, students should be able to:\n- \ndefine filiation\n- \nexplain how maternal filiation is established and such filiation is contested. - \ndifferentiate and analyze the modes of establishment of paternal filiation. - \nanalyze rules pertaining to disowning. - \ndiscuss the rules applicable to proof of filiation. - \ngive ruling on actual issues pertaining both to maternal and paternal filiation. 7.3. Maternal Filiation\nIt must be clear to you that the maternal filiation is the basis for the whole consanguinal\nrelationship since the relationship of kinship by blood emanates from this very\nrelationship. The family relationship consists of three distinct statuses. The status of\nbeing brother and sister, father and child is established only after the establishment of\nmaternal filiation. Without it, a child can’t have the status of being a son or a daughter\nwithin a family for he/she will neither have a father nor a mother. ( Alexander Cairns,\nEversely on Domestic Relations 5th ed, 1973, p.393).",

    "text": "It is this basic formula, which is incorporated in all the means for the establishment of\npaternity. According to Art 740(1) of the 1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia and Art.125(1) of\nthe RFC, the presumption of paternity flows from maternity. A person will be a father of\na child because of the presumption if such a man had relationship provided by law with\nthe mother. Hence, the ascertainment of the mother is a necessary requirement to attribute\na certain child to a given person in all modes of establishment of paternity. This is\nbecause a husband of the mother or a man in an irregular union cannot be presumed to be\nthe father of a child unless it is established that he had such relationship with the mother. The same is true in the case of acknowledgment as the efficacy of acknowledgement\npresupposes the acknowledgment of the mother to the effect that the declaration of the\nperson is well-founded. The establishment of maternal filation is also crucial in cases of\nestablishment of paternity through judicial declarations. The court declares a defendant to\nbe a father of a child if the court is satisfied that the requirements provided under Art.143\nof the RFC are fulfilled. Now, the relevant query is as to how maternal filiation is\nestablished under Ethiopian Family Laws. According to Art.124 of the RFC maternal\nfiliation results from the sole fact that the woman has given birth to a child. This is the\nprovision the whole problem of establishment of maternal filation rests upon. As you can\nunderstand from the above article, the establishment of maternal filiation requires no\nmore than the ascertainment of the fact that the child was born by the said woman. Thus,\na woman who is not in a position of proving that she did give birth to a certain child will\nnot be able to do it by other means such as acknowledgment. Hence, the maternal filiation is established from the sole fact of birth irrespective of the\ntype of relationship that resulted in the conception of the child. Firstly, it is not a\nrequirement that a definite relationship provided by law should exist between the mother\nand someone at the time of conception or birth of the child. The fact that the child was\nborn in an illicit relationship cannot in any way affect the establishment of maternal\nfiliation. For instance, adultery and incest are criminal acts in Ethiopia. Despite this,\nadulterine and incestuous children will have their maternal filiation established equally as\nthose conceived in a legitimate relationship.",

    "text": "What elements must be fulfilled to say that, there exists the fact of birth for the\nestablishment of maternal filiation? In this regard Planiol says, “in relation to French\nLaw, [which is the most important source of Ethiopian family law] that maternal filiation\ncould be said to have been established if it is proved that (1) the alleged mother has given\nbirth to a child when the child in question was born and (2) it is this particular child\nwhom the mother delivered to at that time” (Marcel Planio/ Treatise on Civil Law, (11th\ned. Vol.1 part 1, p.274). These are the elements that evidence adduced to a court is expected to establish. The\nestablishment of maternity is the creation of the legal bond as a result of birth. Whereas\nproof of maternal filiation, as the name indicates is a means by which a person purports\nto prove an already established filliation. It is a means by which a claimant proves the\nfact of birth by mere existence of which the maternal filiation is already established. The\nchild is not, however, required to adduce evidence which directly proves the confinement\nand the identity tests. He may bring foreword any evidence apt to show that he had an\nestablished filiation. ( Meanberetsehay Taddesse, Establishment and Proof of Filiation\nunder Ethiopian Law\n, Senior Thesis, Faculty of Law, A.A.U, 1986, p.4). In relation to the establishment of maternity, the issue worth raising is the legal problems\nsurrounding artificial insemination. In our modern world, through this mechanism it has\nnow become possible to fertilize the ovum and sperm out side the body and transplant the\nembryo into the utrus of a third party or the “hostess” who carries the child for the\nduration of pregnancy and then give birth to it. The resulting infant is said to be\n“biologically the offspring of the woman who contributed the ovum and gestationally the\noffspring of the “hostess” who bore it, (Marry Ana B. Dakley, “Test Tube Babies;\nProposals for Legal Regulations of New Methods of Human Conception and Parental\nDevelopment,” Family Law Quarterly, Vol.8 No.4 (1974) p.391). The issue that crosses your mind here is as to who is the legal mother of the child for the\npurpose of establishing maternal filiation. As it is possible to gather from Art.740(1) of\nthe Civil Code and Art.125 of the RFC, the mother of the child is the one who gave birth\nto the child.",

    "text": "Hence, in the case of artificial insemination, which of the two women has\ngiven birth to a child, the woman from whom the ovum is taken or the one who actually\ndelivered the child? Birth is not defined under Ethiopian law. Thus in the absence of any clear definition of\nthe term you have to see as to what birth ordinarily means. According to Black’s Law\nDictionary (8th ed, 2004), birth means the complete excursion of a new born baby from\nthe mother’s womb. Lexically birth means the emergence of a new individual from the\nbody of some person. According to Jacques Vanderlinden, it constitutes the “extrusion of\nthe child from the mother’s womb whether in a natural way or by an operation like the\ncaesarian section (Jacques Vanderlinden, Commentaries upon the Ethiopian Civil Code\non the Law of Persons 1969, p.9). Birth, thus, presupposes the carriage of the fetus in a\nwomb of a woman for a longer or shorter period of time. It is an event which ordinarily\nfollows pregnancy. We may accordingly maintain that in Ethiopia it is the one who bore\nthe child that may be considered to be the mother. We can, therefore, speak of birth only\nin relation to the “hostess”. The contributor of the ovum may not be considered to have\ngiven birth to a child. In the absence of the fact of birth, she cannot possibly be a mother\nof such child delivered from the “hostess” even if it is her own ovum that was actually\nfertilized. The agreement that may be made between the interested parties to consider the\ncontributor of the ovum the mother is an agreement which does not seem to be\nacceptable. The rules on the establishment of filiation cannot be avoided by the\nagreement of the parties unless there is an express provision authorizing such an\nagreement. As provided in Art.123 of the RFC, there is no provision that permits an\nagreement in derogation to the provisions on the establishment of maternal filiation as\nthere are in cases of paternal filiation whereby the presumed fathers are allowed to settle\nby agreement the possible conflicts of paternity or a father is allowed to assign his\npaternity to a person declaring to be the father. ( Read Arts.146 and 149 of RFC). This is a case in point where there is no congruence between science and the law. Despite\nthe fact that science has come up with new innovations that provide solutions for fertility\nproblems, the solution of this problem in the legal field requires a clear act of the law\nmaker.",

If\nso, what solution (s) would you recommend? (B) Contestation of Maternal Filiation (Arts.163-166 of RFC)\nMaternal filiation, the establishment of which requires the sole fact of birth, can be\ncontested at any time by any interested person (Art.163 of RFC). The action of the\ncontestation of status is intended to disprove a mere matter of fact. In order to obtain a\njudgment abolishing the already existing maternal filiation, the contestant must show to\nthe court that it is not based on the fact of birth. The petitioner must show that either of\nthe elements necessary for the establishment of maternal filiation is missing. Thus, he\nwill have to show to the court either (1) that the woman was not confined at the time\nwhen the child was born and/or (2) even if the woman was confined at the time when the\nchild was born, the child whom she delivered is not the one whose status is in question. In this connection, the plaintiff may bring any evidence as no restriction is put as to the\nevidence that may be advised in connection with the action to contest maternity. With a view to protecting the already established status, the law restricts the conditions\nunder which the contestation of status may be admitted. The permission of the court must\nbe obtained before the petition could be instituted in court (Art.164(1) of RFC). The court\ncan give such a permission if there are presumptions or indications resulting from\nconcrete facts enabling the court to grant permission. What do you think are such\nconcrete facts? It is possible to infer from the above provision that the court has wide discretion for\ngranting the action having regard to the facts presented by the petitioner. But the court\ncan by no means give permission for the institution of the action if the child whose status\nis contested has a filiation resulting from the certificate of birth and is corroborated by a\npossession of status (Art.165 of RFC). Coming to the real party in interest to contest material filiation the right to contest the\nmaternal filiation is not reserved to any specified persons as is the case in contestation of\npaternal filiation. In this regard, Art.163 of the RFC provides that the maternal filiation of\nthe child may be contested at any time by any interested person.",

    "text": "However, what could the\nyardsticks be to determine whether a certain individual is a real party interest in an action\nbrought contesting the maternal filiation? Without prejudice to the above issue the only valid limitation for the action to contest\nstatus lies upon the conditions necessary for the admissibility of the action. All sorts of\nevidence are acceptable although the law is reluctant to accept any sort of evidence unless\ncorroborated by presumptions or concrete facts. The rationales behind such limitations\nare explained by Planiol in the following words:\nThe interests at stake are important and the fear of bribery is felt. Purchased perjury is feared. Therefore, the petitioner could not be \nallowed to institute the action until his allegations had been made \nprobable by a commencement of proof, that is, by something that \nsupports his petition, but that is not of itself sufficient to efface all doubt \nand convince the court. The proof thus commenced may be completed by \nthe hearing of witnesses. A contestation of maternal filiation was brought to the attention of Ethiopian courts in\n1975 E.C.\nThe case was brought by the appellants in the Jimma High Court. The appellants pleaded\nthat a child was born to them on Tir 2/1966 whose whereabouts they did not know since\nHamle 1/1969. They added that this same child named Mestewat, was with the\nrespondents. The appellants requested that the child be returned to them. The\nrespondents, on the other hand, contended that the name of the child who the appellants\nwere claiming to be theirs was Jorina and was born to them on Hidar 10/1965. Each side\nproduced three witnesses to prove their allegation. The witnesses called by the appellants\ntestified that the child was born to the appellants while the witnesses of the respondents\ntestified that the child was born to the respondents. The High Court decided in favor of the respondents by saying that enough evidence was\nnot adduced by the appellants that would enable the court to decide that the child under\nconsideration was not born to the respondents. The case was appealed to the Supreme\nCourt of Ethiopia. The Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the High Court. This court held that the\nissue involved was a question of fact and not of law. The court added that it was for the\nappellants to prove that the child was born to them by such an evidence that could\noutweigh the evidence adduced by the respondents.

    "text": "Paternal Filiation\nEstablishing both maternal and paternal filiation is important, among other things, to\nprotect the right of the child. As your previous discussions show, ascertaining the mother\nof the child is less difficult than ascertaining the father of the child. Despite such\ndifficulty, the law should do whatever possible to ascertain both parents since the child,\ninter alia, has the right to know and be cared for his or her parents which is clearly\nprovided in Art.36(1) of the FDRE Constitution. Besides, Art.7 the convention on the Rights of Child (adopted in 1989) to which Ethiopia\nis a party provides that:\n(1) The child shall,…as far as possible, have the right to know and be cared for by\nhis or her parents. (2) State parties shall ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with\ntheir national laws. Hence, the Ethiopian family laws should implement the principles enshrined under the\nconvention and the constitution. Accordingly, the family laws have provided modes by\nwhich paternal filation is established. Generally, the modes of ascertainment of paternity\nare divided into three. These are:\n(a) presumption of paternity\n(b) acknowledgement paternity\n(c) judicial declaration\nLet us discuss each mode as follows:\n7.4.1. Presumption of Paternity\nThis is the first mode of ascertaining paternity which provided under the RFC (Arts.126-\n130) and the relevant articles of regional Family Laws. Logically, paternity ought to result from the physical begetting of a child by a certain\nman. But there is a problem in the determination of biological paternity. Because of this difficulty, the need to rely on legal presumption is felt for the\nestablishment of paternity. Such a problem, in most legal systems is solved by an almost\nconclusive presumption of paternity. The presumption is attached to a person who may\nhappen to be the husband of the mother of the child or the man in an irregular union at\nthe time of conception or birth. The first element of presumption of paternity is the existence of legally prescribed\nunions. Accordingly, paternal filiation is established if at the time of conception or birth\nof the child the mother had relations provided by law with a certain man. Only children\nborn or conceived within such relationships could benefit from the presumption of\npaternity. According to Art.126 and Art.130 of the RFC, the relationships capable of\ncreating the presumption for the purpose of establishing paternal filiation are marriage\nand irregular union. Thus, Ethiopia gives the presumption of paternity a wider scope.",

    "text": "In\nEthiopia, irregular union is seen on equal footing with marriage in respect to the\npresumption of paternity both under the 1960 Civil Code and the current Family Laws. How can presumption of paternity be justified? As far as children born in a wedlock is concerned, there are strong reasons to justify the\npresumption. Most of the time, it is possible to maintain that a child born in marriage is\nthe child of the husband because of the duties of cohabitation and fidelity. But the\npresumption in Ethiopia equally applies to irregular union. This invites the question\nwhether or not, the duties in the marriage bond also apply to irregular union. As we tried to discuss under chapter six, irregular union is the state of fact, which is\ncreated when a man and a woman live together as husband and wife without having\nconcluded a valid marriage. This requirement of living together as husband and wife\nseems to show that the persons engaged in irregular union are bound to observe duties\nwhich must be observed by spouses. Do you agree? As far as cohabitation is concerned, it is difficult to maintain that there is irregular union\nwithout cohabitation since living together as husband and wife is the crux of irregular\nunion. But, as regards the duty of fidelity, the law no where states that partners in an\nirregular union are duty bound to observe the duty of fidelity. That fidelity is one of\npersonal effects of marriage is clearly provided by law. The provisions of the law\nregulating the relationship between partners in an irregular union, however, do not say\nanything as to this duty either expressly or by way of implication. Despite this, it may be\nargued that the duty of fidelity is imposed upon partners in an irregular union by analogy. According to Menbertsehay:\n“Such analogy seems logical when seen in light of the rigor of the \npresumption of paternity. Presuming a man in an irregular union as a \nfather of a child born or conceived therein seems indeed illogical if the \nmother could at the statutory period of conception freely and without \nfear of any legal sanction copulate with any one. It follows from this \nthat, the law when extending the presumption of paternity in wedlock to \nirregular unions is carrying with it the duties of cohabitation and fidelity \nto the same.” Do you agree with this position? Why/why not? However, the analogy as regards the duty of fidelity becomes senseless when it is seen in\nlight of the Criminal Code of Ethiopia.",

    "text": "For instance, Art.652(1) of the Criminal Code of\nthe FDRE provides that “a spouse bound by a union recognized under the civil law who\ncommits adultery is punishable, upon complaint, by the injured spouse, with simple\nimprovement or fine”. It is clear that the criminal law has sanctioned the duty of fidelity. But such duty exists between spouses. Hence, it is possible to conclude that according to\nthe criminal law partners in an irregular union are not spouses since a spouse is one’s\nhusband or wife by lawful marriage. Therefore, the extension of the duty of fidelity to\npartners in an irregular union cannot be plausible. To which of the above arguments do\nyou subscribe? Why/why not? Therefore, even though the presumption of paternity for children born or conceived in\nwedlock could predominantly be justified on the grounds of the duty of fidelity, its\napplication to irregular unions must be traced to other causes. In this regard, George Krzeczunowicz once wrote that:\n“In order to create irregular union, merely the behavior of the man and \nwoman must be analogous to that of married people. Such fauxmenage \ncreates in fact, in spite of the lack of fidelity duty, a probability of \nconception by the man perhaps not less than in marriage. Such \nprobability is sanctioned by the legal presumption of paternity,” Journal \nof Ethiopian Law, Vol.3, No (1966) p.513)\nThe application of the presumption of paternity to irregular union is based on the\nprobability that the child is born of the man in such a union. In our previous discussions, we have said that the first element of presumption of\npaternity is the existence of legally provided union between the father and the mother. The second element of presumption is birth or conception within the legally provided\nunion. Art.126 of the RFC provides that “a child conceived or born in wedlock has the\nhusband as father”. By the same taken, “a child conceived or born during an irregular\nunion has as father the man engaged in such union”, according to Art.130 of the same\ncode. From this, it is possible to say that Ethiopia adheres to the Roman Law principles\nadopted in many legal systems that says “pate rest quem nuptiae demonstrate” which in\nEnglish means the father is whom the marriage indicates. But a child in order to be\nprotected by this basic formula must meet either of two requirements.",

A child shall be deemed to have been conceived in wedlock if it is \nborn more than 180 days after the celebration of the marriage and less than 300 days \nafter its dissolution and no proof shall be admitted against this presumption (Art.128 \nRFC). A child is presumed to have been conceived in wedlock if it is born on or after the 181st \ndate following celebration of the marriage or on or before the 299th date after dissolution \nof the marriage. ( For instance, if the marriage is dissolved on Tikimt 1st, the child will \nhave to be born at the maximum on Hamle 29th to avail itself of the presumption of \nconception in marriage.) This is because a child shall be deemed to have been conceived \non the 300th day, which precedes its birth. In this, case on 30th of Meskerem. Or if the \nmarriage is celebrated on Tikimt 1st, a child has to be born at least on Miazia 1st that is \non the 181st day. Having the above in mind, let us emphasize on Art.128 (2). It provides: “No proof to the \ncontrary shall be admitted.” What does this mean? It may mean that a child born within \nthe legally fixed period shall enjoy the presumption of conception in marriage, and if it is \nborn within this period, no contrary evidence shall be admitted to rebut the presumption. It is unquestionable that such child is conceived in marriage. But a close reading of \nArt.128 (2) may reveal another meaning. That is, there is no possibility for a child to be \nborn within 180 days from the date of the first intercourse of its mother with a man and a \nchild can never be born on 300th day or more from its mother’s last intercourse with a \nman. Hence, nobody can introduce evidence which proves the birth of a child outside this \nlegally determined period.",

    "text": "This means, if a child is born outside this period, there is no \nchance of presumption of its conception in marriage. Why does the law come up with such a strict duration of pregnancy? Seemingly the \nlegislature has not chosen such period arbitrarily. If it is not an arbitrary period, it must \nhave been based on observation of the period of gestation of human beings. According to \nthe legislature’s understanding, a child is carried in its mother’s womb for a maximum \nperiod of 300 days and the minimum period of 180 days after conception. Is this idea well supported by biological or medical science? Is there really no possibility \nof birth in less than 180 days after celebration of the marriage and more than 300 days \nafter its dissolution? The average duration of pregnancy calculated from the first day of the last menstrual \nperiod of a large number of healthy women has been identified to be very close to 280 \ndays, or 40 weeks. A pregnancy more or less corresponding to this period is called term \nand the child of such pregnancy is said to have fully matured at birth. Usually the expected date of delivery is estimated by adding 7 days to the date of the first \nday of the last menstrual period and counting back 3 months (Naegele’s rule). For\nexample, if the woman’s last menstrual period began on September 10, we would add 7 \ndays to September 10 to make it September 17. Then we count 3 months back and we find \nJune 17 which is the expected date of delivery. This calculation may not sometimes \nexactly conform to the Ethiopian calendar because of the 13th month. It is apparent that \npregnancy is erroneously considered to have begun about 2 weeks before ovulation if the \nduration of pregnancy is so calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period. Nonetheless, clinicians persist in using gestational age or menstrual period to identify \nduration of pregnancy; embryologists and other reproductive biologists more often \nemploy ovulatory age, or fertilization age, both of which are typically 2 weeks shorter. The RFC’s approach is closer to this latter method of calculation since it uses \nintercourse as a basis for determination of the duration of pregnancy. But this does not \nmean that the date of coitus  and that of fertilization is one and the same. There are two fundamental difficulties in determining the duration of pregnancy; one is \nits commencement is of profound obscurity. Another difficulty is that gestation period of \npregnancy is not the same for all women; hence, there are pre-term, term and post term \npregnancies.",

    "text": "That is to mean duration of pregnancies varies considerably. Hence, how \ncan we establish the duration of certain phenomenon unless we can establish the time of \nits beginning as well as its ending? Pregnancy begins when a sperm cell unites with an egg cell in the fallopian tube (the \nplace where fertilization of an egg takes place). Here, the difficulty of determining the \ndate of fertilization is that although we can be reasonably sure that spermatozoa are in \nthe genital tract, we never know when the egg cell will be there to meet them. There are \nno outward signs with which the occurrence of ovulation in a woman can be recognized. This difficulty, accompanied by the extremely elongated viability of spermatozoa in \ngenital tract of the female has made the possible estimation of the date of fertilization \nmore improbable. Living spermatozoa had been found in the uterus from seven to eight \ndays after intercourse, although the generally accepted life span of sperm cells while \nactive and effective is from 72 to 100hrs. Hence, an intercourse made almost a week ago \nmay cause fertilization of egg today. Clinical observations suggest that ovulation occurs \ntwo weeks before the onset of the next menstruation. This means, it occurs midway \nbetween two menstrual cycles in women who regularly menstruate every 28 days. Even if \nthis is the most likely period of ovulation, it may occur at any point in the cycle. From \nthese facts, it has to be admitted that fertilization may occur as long as three weeks after \nthe last menstruation. Such a phenomenon would make it appear that pregnancy has \nlasted three weeks longer than it is actually the case. Other complications related to pregnancy are a small proportion of woman menstruate \nirregularly at prolonged intervals; in others menstruation may be suspended temporarily \ndue to illness or nervous shock, or when they are suckling. Pregnancy may, nevertheless, \noccur under any of these conditions, and it is obvious that calculation with reference to \nmenstruation would be a serious fault. Occasionally, the converse difficulty is met with, \nfor there are women who continue to menstruate for two to three months after conception \nhas taken place. This occurrence is extremely rare; many alleged instances turned out on \ncareful inquiry to be in reality bleeding attacks due to minor pathological conditions, and \nnot because of menstruation. Such occurrence wrongly leads us to believe that pregnancy\nhas lasted a shorter time than is actually the case. Our law has avoided such problems \nthat may be caused by these complications by taking intercourse rather than \nmenstruation for calculating duration of pregnancy.",

    "text": "From the above discussions, we can understand that it is very difficult to determine \nexactly when pregnancy begins and this in turn has an effect on the determination of \npossible period of its end. That is why we lack a general consensus among biologists and \nmedical scientists on the exact period of commencement of pregnancy. Another fundamental difficulty in the determination of duration of pregnancy is the \nexistence of pre-term, term and post term pregnancies. It has been said that the average \nduration of pregnancy is 280 days or 40 weeks when counted from the first date of the \nlast menstruation, that is, 266 days from the most likely date of ovulation. Children of \nsuch births show full development at birth and gynecologists and obstetricians are well \naware of these characteristics of children of term deliveries. This means, they can know \nwithout much difficulty whether a child is a pre term, term or post term child at birth. Short Period of Gestation\nWe may regard all births before 38 weeks as premature, and all those which occur after \nthe 42nd week as protracted. A medical expert witness may have to determine whether the \ndevelopment of a child is proper to the alleged period of gestation. When birth is \npremature, this sort of corroborative evidence is important. The fact that a child has survived for a certain period after its birth furnishes no \nsignificant evidence of maturity for it is well known that though infants born before the \n7th month are less likely to survive, they do so. Cases of survival of children born in the \n5th and 6th months of gestation are not rare. Children born at the 7th month of gestation \nare almost always capable of survival although they are more delicate and in general \nrequire greater care and attention than more mature children. The critical period of \nmaturation appears to be somewhere between the 5th and 6th month. As a result, the \nsurvival of the infant born before this critical time is extremely rare. But some \nobstetricians have reported the survival of infants born even before this critical time. The \nmost important characteristic of pre term children is having considerably small weight. But weight alone cannot be conclusive evidence of a premature birth. Because in few \ninstances, the rate of growth of the fetus during its pregnancy may be very high and at the \ntime of delivery it may have the normal average weight even if its birth is a premature \none.",

    "text": "The converse is also true, that is, due to some irregularities the rate of development \nof a fetus may be very slow in the uterus and its weight may fall far below the average at \nbirth although the birth is a term one. The Ethiopian law does not presume conception in marriage if birth occurs within the \nperiod of 180 days after celebration of the marriage. However, for two reasons we may \naccept this idea of lack of presumption of conception in marriage for such births, \nalthough it could happen in reality. The first reason is that, rearing children born before \n180 days is extremely difficult since they require special treatment and consequently their \nmorality rate is very high. Hence, those who do not enjoy the presumption are negligible. The second reason stems from the presumption under Art.126 of the RFC. According to\nthis article, a child conceived or born in wedlock has the husband of its mother as father. Although a child born within 180 days after celebration of the marriage cannot avail \nitself of presumption of conception in marriage, it can avail itself of the presumption of \npaternity of its mother’s husband because of its birth in marriage. Since the main \npurpose of including duration of pregnancy in the law is to establish paternity and since \na child born within 180 days after celebration of the marriage has the husband of its \nmother as father, it would be pointless to discuss on births which occur less than 180 \ndays father celebration of the marriage, as far as the legitimacy of the child is concerned. To say a few points on Art.126, the law here seems to have envisaged a premarital sexual \nrelation as a child born just the next day after celebration of the marriage is considered \nto have been born in wedlock. We could also think that the law simply presumes paternity \nof the husband irrespective of the existence of premarital sexual relation as long as the \nchild is born in wedlock. So the legislature seems to have chosen presuming the \nfatherhood of the husband who may not be a father in fact. But the husband can disown \nsuch child if he succeeds to prove the non-existence of a premarital relation. Prolongation of Gestation\nPost term pregnancies are of great medico-legal significance than pre-term pregnancies. A post term pregnancy is one that persists for 42 weeks or more from the onset of a \nmenstrual period that is followed by ovulation about 2 weeks later.",

    "text": "Although such a \ndefinition would include perhaps 10% or even more pregnancies, some may not be actual \npost term pregnancies but the result of an error in the estimation of gestation age. “The post term child may continue to gain weight in the uterus and thus be an unusually \nlarge infant at birth. At the other extreme, the intrauterine environment may be hostile to \nthe fetus so that further growth in the uterus is arrested. It may appear at birth to have \nlost considerable weight especially from loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle mass. In the \nextreme case, limbs appear long and very thin… The nails and the amnion are commonly \nbile stained.” Another very important symptom of a post term child is it will have very long nails on \nboth fingers and toes. Post term pregnancies are more important than pre-term ones for medico-legal purposes \nbecause they comprise relatively greater proportion from the total births and the greater \ntendency of survival of post term children. There are a number of reports made by \ngynecologists and obstructions which show post term deliveries. Although some of these \nfigures indicate highly elongated delays and appear to be unbelievable, one thing we \nmust always remember is that post term deliveries are not uncommon. Although well-recorded reports are difficult to find in Ethiopia on such births, foreign \nreports are available. In one study of 15659 births delivered in Birmingham within a year \nthere were 247 births after the end of the 44th week, of which seven were born later than \n48 weeks. The two longest periods were 356 days. It is, of course, very difficult to accept \nthese estimates as reliable without consideration of certain sources of error. We have to \nconsider two factors in relation to this particular point. The first is then, in certain\noccasions the menstrual cycle may become longer, sometimes even longer than two \nmonths. In these cases, if calculations are made with reference to the first day of the last \nmenstrual cycle, the consequence will be an elongated duration of pregnancy. Similar \nproblem may be observed in suckling mothers. Another important point which must be \nconsidered is misleading information from the mother as to the commencement of \npregnancy. Sometimes the information obtained from mothers may not be precise and \neven confusing; some mothers even forget in which month they had their last \nmenstruation. This second problem can be resolved by taking pregnancy tests at the \nearliest possible time and a regular follow-up till the termination of pregnancy.",

    "text": "Senior obstetricians of Birmingham Maternity Hospital have conducted two deliveries \nwhich were under their close inspection since the beginning of the pregnancies, and they \nindicated in their reports that the pregnancies were of 339 and 359 days. Another writer says that sufficient medical data have been accumulated to show that \nhuman pregnancy may be prolonged to a period of 336 calculated days, and that there is \nnothing in the meantime to show that even this figure is the maximum limit beyond which \nprolongation of pregnancy is impossible. Unlike the case in Ethiopia, foreign courts accept post-term births if they are \ncorroborated by expert witnesses. The following reports shall confirm this idea. - \nPregnancies of 331 days and 346 days were ruled legitimate by English courts. - \nThe New York Supreme Court accepted a pregnancy of 335 days to be legitimate. - \nIn the famous Preston Jones V. Preston Jones case of England, 1949, the husband \npetitioned divorce on the grounds of adultery. Since the date of last coitus with \nthe defendant required an extension of the total length of gestation to 360 days. The divorce commissioner dismissed the husband’s petition. The husband \nappealed, the Court of Appeal directed the rehearing of the case. At this juncture, it is clear that duration of pregnancy can vary considerably and as a \nresult it is very difficult to fix the minimum and the maximum period. In particular the \nestablishment of an upper limit for the duration of pregnancy is more difficult. The \nestablishment of an upper limit for the duration of pregnancy is as difficult as discovering \nthe maximum intelligence of a human being. Therefore, from these observations, it can be \nseen duration of pregnancy is a poor test of paternity. It is common knowledge that the great majority of duration of pregnancy fall under the \nperiod fixed by the Ethiopian law. But what the writer wants to clarify here is that, there \nare births outside this period fixed by the law. Especially those births after 300 days \nshould not be neglected, as they constitute a relatively larger proportion. What is the fate \nof children of such births? The answer is clear. They could be made illegitimate. For \nexample, if the marriage is dissolved today and if a child is born just after the 300th day, \nthis child is neither conceived nor born in wedlock. Hence it cannot have the ex-husband \nof its mother as its father. 7.4.2.",

    "text": "Acknowledgment of Paternity\nThis is the second mode of establishment of paternal filiation recognized under both the\n1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia and the current family laws of the country. Under this sub-\nsection, we will discuss the scope of application of acknowledgement, formality\nrequirements, the role of the mother and the child to be acknowledged and proof of\nacknowledgement by focusing on the relevant provisions of the law. (A) Scope of Acknowledgement\nWe can say that this method of establishing paternity, has more practical importance for\nchildren born or conceived out of a legally provided union in Ethiopia, where access to\nthe courts is not as such easy to establish paternity. Because of this, voluntary paternal\nacknowledgment is an important method by which the children conceived or born out of\na legally provided union may gain status vis-à-vis their fathers. This voluntary\ndeclaration of paternity can be used to establish paternal filiation if paternity is not\npossible to establish using the presumptions of paternity. This is clearly provided under\nArt.131 of the RFC which stipulates that when the father of the child is not determined by\napplying the provisions of the preceding articles, the paternal filiation of a child may be\nestablished by acknowledgement of paternity. This seems to give acknowledgement a\nrather narrow scope. Literally, this refers to children conceived and born out of a legally\nprovided union and excludes children that were conceived or born in wedlock or an\nirregular union. Apparently, disowned children seem to have been excluded from the\nvoluntary declaration of paternity. How about incestuous children? Acknowledgement of adulterine and incestuous children is not possible in some legal\nsystems. The rationale behind such prohibition is said to be the protection and stability of\nthe legitimate family relationship. The acknowledgement of adulterine and incestuous\nchildren is considered as an assault to the legitimate family. Its prohibition is based on\nmoral reasons. The law is reluctant, it is said, to uncover the facts of adultery and incest\nso that scandal could be avoided. ( See Planiol, p.813). The modern trend is, however, towards the abolition of such discrimination. The fact that\nadultery and incest are acts which society does not condone is taken as an untenable\nargument to deny adulterine and incestuous children the right of being acknowledged. The social condemnation of certain sexual relationships should not be taken as pretext to\ndiscriminate against those who do not share any responsibility for such relationships (See\nFrank Bates, The Child and the Law, Vol.2,1976, p.505).",

    "text": "The arguments raised by the\nabove writer seems to have been incorporated under the Ethiopian legal system as of the\nadoption of the 1960 Civil Code since there is no clear provision of law which prevents\nchildren born of adulterous or incestuous relationships from being acknowledged. That,\ntoo, does not seem to be the policy of Ethiopia since Ethiopia is committed to insure the\nright of children to know their parents as provided by the FDRE Constitution and the\nChild Convention to which our country is a party. We can conclude that Art.131 is only meant to avoid interference of acknowledgement if\nthe child has an already established filiation by presumption of paternity and not to\nexclude disowned and incestuous children from the benefit of the voluntary\nacknowledgement of paternity. Thus, any child who is merely conceived or born may be acknowledged in so far as such\nan acknowledgment does not interfere with an already established filiation as child\ncannot be acknowledged if he has a father by operation of law. Neither can\nacknowledgment validly establish paternal filiation if the child has already been\nacknowledged unless such an acknowledgment is invalidated (See Art.192 of the RFC). How about a child who has an already established filiation by judicial declaration of\npaternity? Should judicial declaration be a bar to a subsequent acknowledgment? (B) Form of Acknowledgment\nThis requirement of writing was introduced with the promulgation of the Civil Code. Before that, acknowledgment was effected without any requirement of writing. Under the\npre-code customary practices, a man was considered to have acknowledged the child, if\nhe orally said that the child was his. And if the man later on denies that the child is his,\ntestimony of witnesses or the mother’s statement under an oath that the child is an issue\nof sexual relationship with the man sufficed to prove it. Civil Code adopted stricter and more stringent requirements for acknowledgment this is\nbecause Art.748 of the Ethiopian Civil Code states that an acknowledgment of paternity\nshall be of no effect unless it is made in writing. Sub article two of the same article\nprovides that except in cases mentioned in Art.146 of this Code [the civil code] the\nacknowledgement may not be proved by witnesses. The reason for this could be the fact\nthat certain mothers may give their children to a man who could not be the natural father. Under the old customary rule, mothers were tempted to allege that the father of a given\nchild was the one with a higher social or property status. There were occasions where\nchildren were made to have juridical bond to person who could not be their father.",

    "text": "Coming to the RFC and other regional family laws, it has been provided that an\nacknowledgement of paternity results from the declaration made by a man before an\nofficer of civil status or by a will he made in writing or by a document attested by a\ncompetent authority that he is the father of the child. ( Read Art.133 of the RFC, Art.144\nof Amhara Family Code, Art.150 of Oromiya Family Code and Art.163 of Tigray Family\nCode, for instance.) From the above provisions of the law, it is possible to understand that the new family\nlaws have made a significant departure from the 1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia as regards\nform of acknowledgment. Unlike Art.748 of the Civil Code, which requires that\nacknowledgement must be made in writing, the RFC and the regional family laws have\nwidened the modes by which acknowledgement is to be made. Accordingly, a man may\nmake acknowledgement of paternity by:\n(a) A declaration  made before an officer of civil status; or\n(b) A will made in writing; or\n(c) A document attested by a competent authority. What is meant by a declaration in this context? Can the declaration be made in writing? To have a clear understanding of the import of declaration have a look at the Amharic\nversion of Art.133 of the RFC which reads:\n“xND sW yKBR mZgB ðT bmQrB xÆT mçn#N bmGl{ b¸s-W ”L wYM b{/#F\nb¸ÃdRgW n#²z@ wYM bl@§ b¥ÂcWM |LÈN bts-W Æl|LÈN btrUg- snD x¥µYnT xÆT\nmçn#N bmGl{ LJnTN lmqbL YC§LÝÝ”\nThe close reading of the Amharic version of the provision under consideration seems to\nsuggest that the declaration to be made before an officer of civil status is an oral\ndeclaration. But, one can say that the oral declaration made by the man may be reduced\ninto writing by the officer of civil status, signed by the one who made the\nacknowledgement and documented by the office of civil status for evidentiary purposes. However, the question that must be raised is as to what would happen if the oral\ndeclaration is not reduced into a written form? Would it affect the validity of\nacknowledgment? The second form of making acknowledgement is will made in writing. This method must\nbe seen in the light of the relevant provisions of the Ethiopian law of succession. This\nmeans that the will which is made for the acknowledgement of a child is either a\nholograph will or public will since both kinds of will must be made in writing as provided\nunder Arts.881 and 884 of the Civil Code respectively.",

( Read closely Arts.881-891 of the Civil Code). Thirdly, acknowledgement is acceptable if it is made by a document attested by a\ncompetent authority. From this, you can infer that acknowledgement is made in writing\nalthough the written document shall not produce any legal effect unless attested by a\ncompetent authority. Which government organ is a competent authority? The answer to\nthis question varies from region to region. (C) Acknowledgement to be made by whom\nBecause acknowledgement is a juridical act greatly attached to the man who makes the\nacknowledgement, the law, as a matter of principle, provides that acknowledgement is to\nbe made personally by the alleged father of the child. This must be done by the father\neven if the father has not attained the age of majority. However, acknowledgment may be\nmade by an agent when such agent is specially appointed for this purpose by special\npower of attorney which must be approved by the court. As a matter of rule, judicially\ninterdicted persons are incapable to perform juridical acts. However, for the purpose of\nacknowledgement, the law provides that they have the capacity to make\nacknowledgement personally. Despite this, acknowledgement by representation is\npossible provided that the representative has obtained permission from the court to this\neffect. ( Read Art.134 of the RFC). The other situation whereby acknowledgement may be\nmade by a person other than the alleged father is where the father of the child is dead or\nis not in a position of manifesting his will. In this case, the law permits that\nacknowledgment may be made in the name of the deceased by one of his parents. In this\nregard, the new family laws have departed from what is provided under Art.750(2) of the\n1960 Civil Code because the latter has provided that where acknowledgement is not\npossible to be made by the parents of the deceased, it could be made by another paternal\nascendant. From this it is possible to maintain that, the great grand parents of the child\ncould make the acknowledgement of the child. Do you think that the departure made by\nthe new family laws important? (D) Acceptance of Acknowledgement to be made by whom?",

    "text": "Although acknowledgement, as defined under Art.132 of the RFC, is deemed to be made\nwhen a certain man makes a declaration that he considers himself the father of a certain\nchild merely conceived or born, it is not a unilateral act of the father. This is because\nacknowledgement cannot produce effect and cannot establish paternity unless the consent\nof the mother or in certain exceptional circumstances the consent of the maternal grand\nparents or the child to be acknowledged is obtained. According to Art.136 of the RFC, acknowledgement presupposes the admission by the\nmother of the child or by the maternal grandfather or grandmother of the child if the\nmother is dead or not in position to manifest her will. And in default of these, the\nacknowledgement may be accepted by another maternal ascendant or by the guardian of\nthe interdicted person. Acknowledgement cannot be effective unless it is accepted by the\nchild to be acknowledged where such child is of age. If the mother is alive and in position of manifesting her will an acknowledgment could be\neffective only if she accepts it as well-founded. Well founded means based on facts,\nhaving a foundation in fact. In effect the mother is required to attest that such a man\ncould possibly be the father of a child. If the mother is dead or not in a position to manifest her will, the persons allowed to act\nin her stead may accept the declaration. Accepting declarations is quite different from\nacknowledging the same as well-founded. The latter rules out the willingness of the\nmother as requisite element for the effectiveness of acknowledgment. Here, it is not the\nconsent of the mother that is required. If she admits the declaration of the person as well\nfounded she does not have any discretion of obstructing the establishment of the juridical\nbond between her child and the declaring person on the ground of her unwillingness. On the other hand, if it is only acceptance that is required to effect acknowledgment, it is\nin effect the consent of the concerned persons that is required. It is they who will have the\nfinal say whether a child should have a father by acknowledgment or not. They can at\ntheir free will reject the declaration of a person with whom the mother had the only\nmeaningful relationship. On the other hand, they can give their consent to the declaration\nof a man whom the mother had never seen.",

    "text": "This gives the whole opportunity for\nestablishing the paternal filiation of one’s child with anyone who may wish to\nacknowledge him irrespective of the question of biological descent between the child and\nthe person. It is immaterial whether the declaration of the person is well-founded; what\nmatters is the attitude of the person required to accept towards the declaring person. The above problem may be attributable to the difference in wording between sub-article 1\nand sub-article on one hand 2 and 3 of Art.136 of the RFC on the other. However, it is\nsuggested that sub-2 and sub-3 must be seen in light of sub-article 1 of the same article. If\nan unfounded acceptance is required of these persons, the purpose of acknowledgment\nmay be defeated since the above persons may accept acknowledgement which is not\nwell-founded being tempted by the wealth and the social status of the individual who has\nmade the declaration of acknowledgement of paternity. In any case, acknowledgment will be effective unless the person required accepting it\nraises a protest within a month after he has come to know of the declaration (Art.138\nRFC). This is the time given for the concerned persons to protest the declaration. If they\nprotest within such time, the acknowledgment will not be effective. The question one\nmay raise at this point is whether acknowledgment will be effective a month after the\nconcerned person comes to know of it even if the declaration was made long ago, say 10\nyears. No clear answer is provided to regulate such problem. It may be argued that the\nlength of time that causes problem between the date of declaration and the date when the\nperson required to admit it becomes aware of it should not be restricted. The other person involved in acceptance of acknowledgment is the child to be\nacknowledged. As per Art.137 of the RFC, an acknowledgement of paternity shall be of\nno effect unless it has been accepted by the child himself when it is made after the latter\nhas attained majority. However, the acknowledgement is deemed to have been accepted\nwhere such person (the child) has not raised any protest against such acknowledgement\nwithin one month after he come to know of it. (Art.138 RFC). Although acknowledgement is effective when the mother of the child admitted as well-\nfounded, acknowledgement of paternity may not be made after the death of the child. (Art.139 RFC). The prime purpose of acknowledgement is to insure the right of children\nto know their father and to be cared of such father.",

    "text": "In other words, acknowledgement is\nan important instrument of avoiding fatherlessness. Hence, since the purpose of\nacknowledgment of paternity is not to benefit the man who declares to be the father, no\npurpose would be served if a man is allowed to acknowledge a child after the death of the\nchild. This is because if acknowledgement after the death of the child is allowed, some\nindividuals may make acknowledgement for the sole purpose of inheriting the deceased\nchild without discharging their parental obligations during the life time of the child. However, acknowledgement after the death of the child is possible where the deceased\nhas left descendants. F. Non-revocability of Acknowledgement (Art.140 of RFC)- Normally, an individual\ndoes not make acknowledgement unless he has justifiable grounds to do so. Hence, he\nmakes acknowledgement when he is, as far as his understanding goes, sure that he is the\ntrue father of the child. Once he has made an acknowledgement of his own free (without\nany external influence or pressure), he is not allowed to revoke the acknowledgement of\npaternity for allowing revocation of acknowledgement will result in disturbing the status\nwhich has already been maintained. Here the principle Pacta Sunt Servanda\n(gentleman’s word is his bond) works. However, revocation of acknowledgement may be\nallowed when the father who made the acknowledgment is a minor. Art.140(2) of the\nRFC provides that a minor who has acknowledged a child may revoke such\nacknowledgement for so long as he is incapable and within one year following the\ncessation of his incapacity, unless his guardian consented to the acknowledgement. Even\nin this case, revocation of acknowledgement is strictly personal to the minor since the law\nprovides that revocation may not be made by his legal representatives nor by his heirs. Can the minor revoke the acknowledgement unilaterally or by the order of the\ncourt? G. Annulment of Acknowledgement\nIt is obvious that acknowledgment is a juridical act. As such, the consent of the person\nwho makes acknowledgement must not be vitiated. If the consent of the acknowledger is\nvitiated by a vice of consent, acknowledgement may be annulled (invalidated). However,\nunlike the Ethiopian Law of contract wherein violence, mistake and fraud are vices of\nconsent resulting in invalidation of a contract, the family law as a rule has confined the\nground of annulment of acknowledgement only to violence as clearly stipulated under\nArt.141(1) of the RFC.",

H. Several Acknowledgements Prohibited (Art.142 RFC)- Naturally, a child cannot be\nattributed to two or more persons for a child has only one biological father. It is because\nof this that Art.142 of the RFC prohibits several acknowledgements. According to this\narticle, where an acknowledgement of paternity has been made in regard to a child, no\nother acknowledgement of child by another man shall be permitted unless the first\nacknowledgement has been annulled. Therefore, where the first acknowledgement is\nannulled on account of grounds of annulment provided under Art.141 of the RFC,\nanother acknowledgement may be validly made. But, cannot another acknowledgement\nbe possible where the first acknowledgement is revoked as per Art.140 of the RFC? Is\nthere any difference between revocation and annulment as used in this context? 7.4.3. Judicial Declaration of Paternity (Arts.143-145 of the RFC)\nThis is the third mode of establishing paternity both under the Civil Code of Ethiopia and\nthe new family laws of the country although the new laws have made remarkable\ndepartures from the Civil Code by widening the grounds for making judicial declaration\nby the court (Read Art.758-761 of the Civil Code and Arts.143-145 of the RFC). Under this mode of establishment of paternity, a child who does not have a father either\nthrough the operation of the presumption of paternity or by acknowledgement can have a\nfather only if the court declares a certain man to be his father. The court makes such\ndeclaration where it is satisfied that one of the grounds which justify judicial declaration\nof paternity is found. According to Art.758 of the Civil Code the grounds which\ndeclaration of paternity by the court was abduction and rape. However, the RFC and\nregional family laws have added other grounds of judicial declaration. Art.143 of the\nRFC, for instance, provides that:\nWhere, after applying the preceding articles the father of the child is not ascertained, a \njudicial declaration of paternity may be obtained under the following conditions:\n(a) In the case where the mother has been the victim of abduction or rape at the time \nof the conception of the child.",

(c) In the case where there exists letters or other documents written by the claimed \nfather which unequivocally proves paternity. (d) In the case where the claimed father and mother of the child have lived together \nin continuous sexual relation, without having a legally recognized union in the \nperiod regarded by law as the period of pregnancy. (e) In the case where the person claimed to be the father of the child participated in \nthe maintenance, care and education of the child in the capacity of a father. Let us discuss the above grounds one by one briefly as follows. (a) When some one rapes or abducts the mother of the child, the court shall declare the\nrapist or the abductor as the father of the child. The court shall pass this declaration,\nonly if the child is born within the legally presumed period of pregnancy. The child\nshould be born within 181st day to 299th days from the rape or abduction of the\nmother. However, the question to be raised here is whether or not the rapist or\nabductor should be convicted by a criminal bench in order to pass judicial declaration\nof paternity. It may be validly argued that the mother should show to the satisfaction of the court\nthat there exist facts which are by themselves sufficient to meet the definitional\nrequirements of rape or abduction. But it must be born in mind that all she is required\nto prove is only the facts and not any more. If she proves the facts the court must\ndeclare the paternity unless the defendant can avail himself of the defense available to\nhim. If the facts are proved it does not seem that, the plaintiff will be required to\nadduce more evidence to show that the defendant did the acts in such a situation as to\nbe criminally convicted. Thus, the court must declare the paternity after proof of the\nfacts even if the defendant was acquitted by a criminal court. This line of argument may be justified by difference in purpose of the criminal and\nthe civil proceedings. The paternity action has as its purpose the ascertainment of\npaternity. The very aim justifies the exclusion of the defenses or the responsibility\nrequirements prescribed in the Criminal Code.",

    "text": "(b) A man by abuse of authority, or promise of marriage, or by other intentional\ndeception seduces the mother of the child, such man may also be declared the father\nof the child. This sub-article of 143 of the RFC and the respective articles of the\nregional family laws are meant to alliviate a social problem faced by mothers and\nchildren in Ethiopia. Some men, using the economic weakness of woman, have sex\nby promising marriage. However, when the woman conceives, the man declines to\naccept that they are fathers of the child. This creates problem on the mother and the\nchild. The mother is compelled to shoulder the duty of upbringing the child alone. The child, in such circumstances, does not get the treatment that he can get from a\nfather unless such man is judicially declared to be the father of the child. Mehari\nRedae has neatly explained the rationale behind the inclusion of this provision in his\nbook.(Read Mehari Redae; ytššlWN yb@tsB HG lmgNzB y¸rÇ xNÄND n_ïC¿ Q{\nh#lT¿ 1999 ›.M, pp.45-46). However, in order to attribute such child to such a father, a woman who is the victim\nof such seduction should prove at least two facts. In the first place, she is expected to\nshow that she was victim of seduction. In the second place, she must show that her\nchild was conceived within the legally presumed period of pregnancy from the time\nof the sexual intercourse with the man as a result of seduction. (c) What is provided under Art.143(c) is also another innovative addition to the grounds\nfor judicial declaration of paternity. According to this ground, where there are letters\nor other documents which are written by the claimed father which unequivocally\nprove paternity the man can be declared to be the father of the child. However, such\ndocuments alone may not suffice to declare paternity by the court. The court should\nmake further enquiry and investigation as to the relationship of the alleged father and\nthe mother of the child. Have a look at the following example. X wrote a letter to his girl friend which reads:\n“Are you fine, my darling? Is our little one doing fine? Life is difficult \nfor me here for I am always longing for you and my son. I will come \nsoon and visit you and our baby.” Can the above letter, if adduced by the mother of the child as evidence, suffice to\nmake judicial declaration of paternity?",

    "text": "(d) The fourth ground of judicial declaration of paternity is where the claimed father and\nmother lived together in continuous sexual relationship, without concluding marriage\nor establishing an irregular union. It is clear that a man and a woman may have\ncontinuous sexual intercourse during the time of betrothal or during the time of\nfriendship without establishing betrothal. In this case, the man can be declared to be\nthe father of the child provided that the woman is able to prove two facts. The first is\nthat she has to prove that there was continuous sexual intercourse between them and\nsecondly that the child was born within the legally presumed time of pregnancy. (e) The last ground of making judicial declaration of paternity has a lot to do with the acts\nof the claimed father towards the child. If the mother of the child is able to prove that\nthe claimed father of the child has voluntarily and in the capacity of a father\nparticipated in the maintenance, care and education of the child, judicial declaration\nof paternity may be made. Having discussed the ground which, if proved by the plaintiff to the satisfaction of the\ncourt serve for the making of judicial declaration, the next important question to be raised\nis who is the real party in interest to bring suit against the claimed father so that the court\ncan make judicial declaration of paternity? Despite the above grounds of establishing paternity by judicial declaration, an action\nbrought for declaration of paternity shall be of no effect where the conditions enumerated\nunder Art.145 of the RFC are proved to exist. (a) In case where the mother of the child had sexual relationship with another man in\nthe period regarded by law as the period of pregnancy unless it is proved by\nmedical or other reliable evidence that such man is not the father of the child. (b) In case where the claimed person could not be the father of the child because he\nwas absent or has been a victim of accident during the period regarded by law as\nthe period of pregnancy. (c) In case where the person claimed to be the father of the child decisively proves\nby blood examination or other reliable evidence that he could not be the father of\nthe child. Art.759 of the Civil Code provides that the action for judicial declaration of paternity\nmay be instituted only by the mother of the child, or if she is dead or not in a position to\nmanifest her will by the guardian of the child.",

    "text": "From the provision of the Civil Code, it is\nclear that the only person who has a vested interest to bring action for judicial declaration\nof paternity was the mother. When the mother is dead or unable to manifest her will the\nguardian of the child could institute suit for judicial declaration of paternity. Bear in mind\nthat grand parents and other relatives of the child cannot institute such suit unless they are\nguardians of the child. Unlike the Civil Code of Ethiopia, the new family laws do not\nhave incorporated a provision in this regard. Hence it is natural to put the question as to\nwho can institute an action for judicial declaration of paternity. The other issue that need to be raised is as to when the action for the declaration of\npaternity to be instituted? Again this question was clearly answered by Art.752(2) of the\nCivil Code which reads:\n“The action for the judicial declaration of paternity may not be instituted two years after\nthe birth of the child or after the sentence of a criminal court in regard to the abduction or\nrape.” The new family laws are silent in this regard. Does this mean that an action for judicial\ndeclaration of paternity can be brought at any time? If we accept this, does this bring a\njust result? 7.4.4. Regulation of Conflict Paternity\nThe time framework and scope within which the presumption of paternity applies may\nresult in attributing one child to two or more fathers. This is basically because it is\noperative if a child is either conceived or born in wedlock or irregular union as the case\nmay be. Both these elements when seen separately or taken together can give rise to\nsituations when the law can attribute the same child to two or more fathers. Before\nconsidering how this could happen, it is important to note that this problem of attributing\nthe same child to different fathers can come about only in relation to one mode of\nestablishment of paternity. The wording of Art.146 of the RFC is confusing since it\nprovides that “when on applying the preceding articles a child must be attributed to\nseveral fathers a regulation of paternity may be made by agreement between the person to\nwhom the paternity of the child is thus attributed by the law. This seems to indicate the possibility of conflict of paternity by application of one or\nmore modes of establishment of paternity as, for example, a child having a father by\npresumption of paternity and by acknowledgment at the sometime.",

    "text": "However, the\nregulation of paternity is applicable only when a child is attributed to two or more\npersons by the presumption of paternity. This could be understood from the nature of the\nmodes of establishment of paternity. The nature of the application of the modes of establishment of paternity itself excludes\nthe possibility of one child having two fathers by different modes of establishing\npaternity. The three modes are mutually exclusive; one of the three modes excludes the\nother two. Thus, if a child has his mother’s husband as a father, he cannot have another\nfather either through acknowledgment or judicial declaration. Similarly, a child can have\na father by judicial declaration, if he has no father either by the presumption of law or by\nacknowledgment. Therefore, there is no possibility where a child can have two fathers by\noperation of two modes of establishing paternity in different “hierarchies”. Neither can a\nchild have two fathers by acknowledgment nor judicial declaration of paternity. A child\ncannot be validly acknowledged by more than one person at the same time for stronger\nreason, the court cannot declare two persons to be the fathers of the child. The conflict arises when the mother has a relation (marriage or irregular union) provided\nby law with two or more persons and the child could simultaneously be attributed to the\nperson in each relation. The conflict of paternity arising because of the aforementioned\nreason has two possible solutions as provided under the RFC and the regional family\nlaws. The persons to whom paternity of the same child is attributed may contractually agree to\nforfeit his paternity. Such an agreement is to be attested by three witnesses and approved\nby the court and the mother must be heard in person except in cases of force majeure\n(Art.147 of the RFC). According to Art.152 of the RFC the regulation of paternity, if\nvalidly made, is irrevocable. This is done to keep the status of the child undisturbed. Although revocation of such agreement either unilaterally or by court order is prohibited\nby Art.152 of the RFC with no exception, the agreement on the assignment of paternity\nmay be annulled by the court on the ground of violence (Art.153(1) of the RFC). This is the only vice of consent, the proof of which is by itself enough to annual the\nagreement. If the party who made the agreement and who moves to annual the agreement\nproves that he had concluded the agreement under violence, he is not required to further\nshow that the child could not be conceived of him.",

    "text": "The annulment of the contract would\nresult in making both parties to the agreement father as they were before the conclusion\nof the agreement. The invalidation of the agreement has the effect of restoring the\nposition that they had before the conclusion of the agreement. Invalidation of the agreement for regulating paternity on the grounds of error or fraud is\nstricter than in the general contract. Either party can succeed in invalidating the\nagreement for regulation of paternity by invoking mistake or fraud if he can in addition\ndecisively prove that the child was not conceived of him (Read AA.153(2) of RFC). Thus, fraud or error, unlike duress is not by itself sufficient to invalidate the agreement. In addition to either of these two vices, the person invoking the invalidation of the\nagreement must be in a position to show that the child was not born to the person who has\nby virtue of the agreement become the father of the child. Therefore, assume that Abebe\nand Kebede who are both the legally presumed fathers of Getnet decided by agreement\nthat Kebede is the father. Abebe succeed in invalidating the agreement on the ground of\nmistake or fraud if he can decisively prove that Kebede cannot be the father of Getnet. Once the agreement is annulled or if the presumed fathers failed to reach  an agreement \nthe conflict of paternity will be solved by application of the legal presumption as \nprovided under Art.148 of the RFC which states that “failing regulation of paternity, the \nfollowing two presumptions shall be applied successively where appropriate:\n(a) The child shall be attributed to the husband of the mother in preference to the \nman who has an irregular union with the mother. (b) The child shall be attributed to the husband or the man with whom the mother is \nliving at the time of the birth, in preference to the husband or the man with whom \nshe was living at the time of the conception. So, the decisive proof that the child was not conceived of either party will have the effect\nof annulling the agreement and no more. It will not go beyond that and operate to rebut\nthe presumption laid down by law. It seems illusory to hold some one as a father after it\nhas been decisively proved that the child was not conceived of him. But this paradoxical\nsolution is in line with the general protective mechanism of the first presumption\nincorporated under Art.148 of the RFC which purports to solve the conflict of paternity if\nthe mother had a marriage and irregular union at the material time.",

    "text": "It prefers the husband\nto the man in irregular union even if the mother was living with the latter at the time\nwhen the child was born. The second presumption will apply only if the conflict cannot get a solution under the\nfirst presumption. This will not interfere with the domain of the first presumption i.e.,\nwhen the conflict of paternity is between a person in an irregular union and the husband\nof the mother. The application of sub (b) of Art.148 is thus restricted to situations when\nthe conflict is between two husbands or two persons engaged in irregular union with the\nmother. Assignment of paternity by agreement by virtue of Art.149 of the RFC is possible where \nthe requirements provided there in are satisfied Art.149 of the RFC provides that:\n(1) Where the child is born within 210 days from the conclusion of marriage or the \ncommencement of the irregular union, the husband or the man who is living with \nthe woman may, by agreement, assign the paternity of the child to another person \nwho declares that he is the father of the child. (2) Where the child is born more than 210 days after the dissolution of the marriage \nor the cessation of the irregular union, the husband or the man who lived with the \nmother shall have the right provided in the preceding sub-article. Though it is not clear why the law has required the duration to be 210 days, it seems to\nhave the purpose of mitigating the force of the presumptions of paternity when the\nconception of the child could actually have taken place out of the legally provided union. Likewise, the law allows the assignment of paternity for children born more than 210\ndays after the dissolution of marriage or cessation of irregular union taking the possibility\nthat the child could have been conceived after the end of the union. The force of the\npresumption extends up to the 299th day after the end of the union. But a child born after\n210 days from the end of the union could have possibly been conceived after the end of\nsuch union. Therefore, the assignment of paternity by agreement is the possible way whereby the\nfather short of the facts sufficient for disowning a child, he thinks is born of another man,\nassigns his paternal status to the person declaring to be the father, who is not in a position\nof effecting acknowledgement because the child has a valid paternal filiation by\npresumption of paternity. Coming to formality, such an agreement must be attested by three witnesses and\napproved by court as provided under Art.150 of the RFC.",

    "text": "Moreover, the mother must be\nheard in person except in cases of force majeuere. The agreement in the first case has as its object the transfer of paternity to a person who\nclaims to be the biological father. The hearing of the mother thus seems to be a means for\nensuring, to the extent possible, the well foundedness of the person’s declarations. It is\nthere to see to it that the paternity which results from the agreement would possibly\ncorrespond with biological paternity of the same. So, though the mother is not required to\naccept the declaration of the person, it is very likely that, the court will be influenced by\nthe statements of the mother in approving the agreement. It is unlikely that the court will\napprove the agreement which has assigned paternity if the mother of the child makes it\nclear to the court that she had no sexual intercourse with the man at the time of\nconception. As a matter of principle, the agreement of assignment of paternity must be concluded by\nthe interested parties themselves. This is so when the parties have attained the age of\nmajority and are not judicially interdicted. Where the parties to such agreement have not\nattained majority or are judicially interdicted, the agreement may be concluded by\nspecially appointed agents by a special power of attorney approved by the court (Art.151\nof the RFC). However, one issue is worth raising in connection with making agreements\nby agent. Can contracting parties to an agreement which assigns paternity, be represented\nso long as the representatives of the parties are appointed by a special power of attorney\nand approved by the court? Or are only minors and judicially interdicted persons who are\nallowed to appoint agents who would conclude agreements of assignment of paternity? Read Art.151 of the RFC critically and try to respond to this query. 7.4.5. Disowning\n(A) Meaning of Disowning\nThe familiar rule concerning paternity, ‘Pater est quem nuptiae demonstat, which has\npassed into all modern system of jurisprudence raises a legal presumption that a child\nconceived during marriage has for his father the husband (Joseph Cullen Ayer,. “Legitimacy and Marriage”, Harvard Law Review, Vol.16, p.23). Though this\npresumption has been accepted in all modern legal systems it is not conclusive. It can be\nrebutted by the husband of the mother, if he is not in fact the father of his wife’s child, by\ninstituting an action to have it judicially declared that he is not the father. This act is\ncalled disowning.",

    "text": "In France and Louisiana, it is referred to as disavowal. Therefore,\ndisowning, as Planiol defines it, is a “…term applied to the act the purpose of which is to\nwipe out the presumption of paternity established against the husband, when he cannot be\nthe child’s father (Planiol, p.780). In the Ethiopian Civil Code and the new family laws, there is no provision expressly\ndefining what disowning is. When we read together the relevant provisions pertaining to\ndisowning, we can understand that it as an action by which the husband or the man in an\nirregular union tries to disclaim the presumption of paternity established against him, if\nhe believes that he cannot be the father. Disowning shows that the presumed father owns the status of paternity. Persons other\nthan the presumptive father have nothing to disown. It is less accurate for the law to use\nthe term “disowning”, when after the presumed father death (or incapacitation), his heirs\ncontest the presumption of paternity established against him. Yet, Art.177 of the RFC the\nuses the term “Action to disown” to designate the action brought by the presumed\nfather’s heirs. In common law literatures, for example, since persons other than the\npresumptive father are entitled to contest the presumption of his paternity we don’t find\nthe word “disowning”. Instead we find “rebutting the presumption of paternity”. ( Read\nPlaniol, p.780). (B) Disowning as Distinguished from Other Modes of Contesting Legitimacy\nDisowning and other modes of contesting legitimacy are sometimes confused with one\nanother. Therefore, it is important that the line of distinction be drawn, since different\nrules apply to each of them. Legitimacy is a status of a child being born in a legally recognized union or within a\ncompetent time after its termination under circumstances that the presumptive father can\nbe the father. And its contestation involves contesting that a certain child is not his,\nbecause its birth or conception did not take place during the subsistence of a relationship\nthat is legally recognized, or because no existence of such a relationship at all (See Pascal\n, 5th ed.1963, Vol.2, p.182). Also one may contest\nRA; Reading in Louisiana Family Law\nthat the child was born after the declaration of the absence of the presumptive father. Still, one may contest the delivery of the mother or the identity of the child.",

    "text": "In other\nwords, one can bring an action in contestation of maternity as per Art.163-166 of the\nRFC as we have seen under our previous discussions. In suit of disowning, however, one is specially contesting that the presumption of\npaternity taken against him is contrary to the truth. Here, the person is contesting his\npaternity. As Art.167 of the RFC states, disowning is the only means by which the\npaternity of person may be contested. Therefore, action to disown is brought to disclaim\nthe legitimacy of children who are under the protection of the legal presumption that they\nare the children of the person contesting. From the above discussion, you can see that unlike the other modes of contesting\nlegitimacy, disowning is contestation of paternity. Presumption of paternity is a sin qua\nnon for disowning. In contestation of legitimacy, however, presumption of paternity is\nnot a necessary requirement and the contestation revolves around the issue as to whether\nthe very presumption exists or not. Or the question in contestation of legitimacy lies on\nthe very conditions bearing upon the presumption. The strong presumption which the law lays down will not achieve just results if it is\nproved that it is not in harmony with biological facts Karl W. Cavanaugh, “Action\nknaveau-challenging the Presumption of paternity”, (Louisianan Law Review, Vol.23\n(1962) p.759). Therefore, although the legal presumption of paternity, once established, is difficult to\navoid the protection which the law gives to children is at logger hood with social realism\nand the child becomes fatherless if his mother’s husband can decisively prove that he\ncannot be the father of the child. In Ethiopia, the presumption of paternity of a person conceived or born in wedlock or an\nirregular union can be rebutted only by the person to whom the law attributes the\npaternity by proving decisively that he could not have sexual intercourse with the mother\nduring the period between the 300th and 180th day before the birth of the child (Art.168 of\nthe RFC). In this regard, the law presumes that the spouses shall be deemed to have had\nno sexual intercourse with one another during the time when they actually lived\nseparately following a petition for divorce made by one of them or in consequence of an\nagreement concluded between them (Art.169(1). However, this is a rebutable\npresumption as provided under sub-article two of the same article. This is one aspect of\nthe protection of the presumption of paternity.",

    "text": "Despite this, Art.177 of the RFC permits that where the person to whom the paternity of\nthe child is attributed by law dies or becomes incapacitated within the time fixed by law\n(i.e., Art.176 of the same code) for instituting the action to disown, one of his\ndescendants, in his stead, may institute an action to disown. Art.177 (2) provides that in\ndefault of descendants, the right to disown may be exercised by his father, mother or in\ntheir default, by one of his ascendants. In default of ascendants, it may be exercised by\none of his brothers or sisters, to the exclusion of any other heir or representative. This action brought to disown a child whose filiation is established by law is stringent\nboth in the mode and time for making it. In our law rebutting of the presumption that the\nchild was born by a married woman is that of the husband is divided into three steps. First, a contestant may prove decisively that the mother did not have intercourse with him\nat the time of the child’s conception. Second, if the presumption of intercourse is not\ndisproved the contestant may decisively prove that it is absolutely impossible for the\nchild to have been produced by intercourse between the mother and him. Third, the\npresumed father could produce any facts to disprove his paternity if the maternal filiation\nis established by the action to claim status (Read Arts.168, 170 and 176(2) of the RFC). The facts that must be proved to contest the presumption differ depending on which of\nthese three points the contestant bases his claim. In the first situation, the presumption could be removed if the contestant could show that\nhe was not in such a situation as to have had any sexual intercourse with the mother at the\ntime when the child must have been conceived. But the presumption cannot be rebutted\nby circumstances which only create doubt and suspicion. It must be proved decisively. In\nthis regard, let us take the following actual case decided by Ethiopian courts. In one case, the wife and the husband concluded marriage on the 22nd of Magabit 1980. When the wife became pregnant, the husband took her to Dazazmatch Belcha Hospital\nand she was diagnosed by a medical doctor on Sene 19,1980 E.C, and the medical\nexamination revealed that there was a 16 weeks old fetus in her womb. Because of this,\nthe lady deserted her husband. Later on she brought suit against the husband praying the\ncourt to declare that the husband was the father of the child.",

    "text": "In her claim, she made it\nclear that the child was born on Tahisas 21,1981 E.C. However, the man /husband/\nargued that, although the child was born within the period of time prescribed by the law\nas period of pregnancy, he strongly argued that the child could not be his as per the\nfinding of the medical examination. The court which heard the case rejected the claim of\nthe wife accepting the arguments of the husband since the husband was able to prove\ndecisively that pregnancy took place before marriage was concluded since it was proved\nthat by the 18th of Sene (three months after the conclusion of marriage) she was a four\nmonths pregnant. Aggrieved by the decision of the court of rendition, she appealed to Supreme Court. The\nSupreme Court confirmed the decision of the High Court (Decision rendered by the\nSupreme Court on Hidar of 1985 E.C Sup. Ct.1985 E.C). Do you think that the husband in our case decisively rebutted the legal\npresumption? As per Art.171 of the RFC, if the person contesting the presumption bases his move on\nthe absolute impossibility of his paternity, this needs a permission from the court. According to Art.171(2) of the RFC the court shall grant permission where there are\npresumptions or serious indications resulting from sufficient and reliable facts enabling\nthe court to accept the action. Art.172 of the RFC considers as sufficient grounds for granting the action to disown,\nscientifically recognized incompatible physical characteristics of the child and the father,\nor the concealment of the birth or pregnancy to the presumed father “under circumstances\nwhich are apt to create doubts as regards his paternity.” The concealment of the birth or\nconception, as a ground for disowning can be justified on the ground that a mother has no\nreason to conceal the conception or the birth of a child from her husband if he is the\nfather. Such a concealment is in the nature of an admission of her wrong. It is important\nto note here that the proof that the mother has hidden the conception or birth of the child\ndoes not in any way mean that the contestant will be required to disprove paternity by\neasier and simpler means. This is in fact the case in some jurisdictions. For instance, in\nFrench Law, if it is proved that the mother has hidden the birth or conception, the\npresumed father he is not required to prove the absolute impossibility of paternity (see\nPlaniol, p.785). In our law, these are only preliminary steps made to convince the court to grant\npermission to institute the action.",

    "text": "It seems that proof of physical incompatibility is only a\npreliminary step and not an end by itself. The exclusionary blood typing mechanisms\nwhich are in some jurisdictions taken to be conclusive to disown a child may prove the\nincompatible physical characteristics of the child and the father. This may raise a\nquestion of whether or not blood typing, if at all it is possible, is conclusive or simply\nfalls within the category of presumptions and physical characteristics the proof of which\nis only relevant for the admissibility of the action. In the modern world, many foreign courts have taken blood grouping tests indicating non\npaternity, as conclusive to rebut the presumption of paternity if it was properly conducted\nalthough they recognized the possibility of defect in testing process. ( To have a better\nunderstanding, read, 10 American Jurisprudence p.869). In Ethiopia its solution revolves around the meaning that may be given to evidence\ndecisively proving the absolute impossibility of paternity. In foreign countries similar\nprovisions have been interpreted as requiring:\nClear, distinct, satisfactory and conclusive evidence as to convince the \ncourt that the child is not the issue of the union. Such evidence must \nconvince the court beyond any reasonable doubt, and is thus equivalent to \nthe proof in criminal action i.e., a  more stringent test applied than \nnormally applicable to civil action where issues are decided on a mere \nbalance of probability. ( Read Menbere Tsehay Taddesse, p. 26)\nWe maintain that Art.170 of the RFC and equivalent Regional Family Laws provisions\nshould be interpreted on similar lines. Hence, it may be argued that exclusionary blood\ntyping mechanisms if done properly should be conclusive to rebut the presumption\npaternity. And sterility may also be taken as such because it decisively proves that the\nhusband could not be the father. However, by virtue of Art.178 of the RFC the father cannot disown a child in spite of the\nabsolute impossibility of his paternity the child was conceived by an artificial\ninsemination to which he consented in writing. What do you think is the rationale\nbehind this Article? Finally, let us say few words in connection with plaintiff in suit, defendant in the suit and\nperiod of limitation. As we have said previously, in order to maintain the presumption of\npaternity strong, Art.174 (1) of the RFC stipulates that the presumed father is the only\nperson who can institute an action for disowning so long as he is alive.",

Even a judicially interdicted person\ncan bring such action when he gets permission from the court although he may be\nrepresented by his guardian when the guardian obtains permission from the court to do so\nin the name of the judicially interdicted person (Art.175 of the RFC). As regards the\nperson against whom the action to disown is brought Art.179 (1) of the RFC provides that\nsuch action shall be brought against the child or where he/she is dead, against his/her\nheirs and sub-2 of the same article makes it mandatory that the mother of the child is\njoined in the suit. Where the child is a minor, obviously, he shall be represented by a tutor\nad hoc appointed for this purpose by the court. The action to disown the child must be brought within the time limit provided by the law. In this regard, Art.176(1) of the RFC makes it clear that an action to disown shall be\ninstituted by the man to whom paternity of the child is attributed by law within 180 days\nfollowing the day he knew or should have known the birth of the child.

The following court case is pertinent to understand the issue at hand\n(Civil Appeal No 906, Supreme Court, 1983 E.C). The appeal was lodged to the Supreme Court from a decision made by the North Shewa\nHigh Court decided on the 16th of Hidar 1980 E.C under file No.180/81. The applicant\nnamed Girma  Habtewold, applied to the Zonal Court to disown a child presumed to have\nbeen born of him.

    "text": "In his appeal to Supreme Court the appellant argued that the 180 days must be reckoned\nfollowing the day he knew or should have known the birth of the child. The respondent\non her part argued that since the appellant and the respondent were living in the same\ntown, he should have known the birth of the child. The appellate court confirmed the decision of the high court and reasoned that actions for\ndisowning should be instituted within 180 days from the birth of the child. As you can understand, the decision of the above courts would be otherwise if the case\nwere brought to court after Art.792(1) of the Civil Code has been replaced by Art.176(2)\nof the RFC and the respective provisions of regional family laws since the new family\ncodes have stipulated that the 180 days is to be counted from the time when the presumed\nfather new or should have known the birth of the child. 7.5. Proof of Filiation\n7.5.1. General\nThe previous discussions show that paternal filiation is established by three mutually\nexclusive modes. Proof of filiation is not establishment of filiation but it is rather proving\nthe existence of such fact where such fact is contested by interested third parties. In this\nregard, proof of filiation pertains to proving that a child is the son or daughter of a certain\nman or woman. In the modern world, the primary mode of proof of filiation is record of birth. Record of\nbirth, as provided under Art.99 of the Civil Code of Ethiopia, contains the day, month\nand year of the birth, the sex of the child, the first names which are given to him or her,\nthe names, first names, dates and places of birth of this father and mother and where\nappropriate the names, first names, date and place of birth of the person making the\ndeclaration. In the developed countries, as record of birth is properly maintained, it is easy to avoid\nconfusions as to the identity of the child and the identity of the parents. In developing\ncountries such as ours, there are no organized institutions for maintaining record of birth\nproperly. Of course, in Ethiopia it was provided under Art.101(1) of the Civil Code that\nthe birth of a child may be declared to the officer of Civil Status by any person. But\nArt.100(2) of the same code declares that such birth must be declared by the father of the\nchild, or in his default by the mother or guardian of the child, or in default, by the person\nwho has taken care of the child.",

    "text": "In addition, the officer of civil status was duty bound to\ndraw up the record of birth of his own motion if he is aware of the birth. By the same\ntoken, failure to get registered a child was a criminal act under the 1957 penal code as is\nunder the new Criminal Code (Art.656(1) of the FDRE Criminal Code). Despite the above legal provisions, record of birth has remained an exercise in futility\nsince the office of civil status has not been established in Ethiopia. Art.7 (1) of the Child Convention which has been ratified by Ethiopia and which is the\nintegral part of the Ethiopian law provides that births must be recorded immediately\nfollowing the birth of children. Because the convention is part and parcel of the Ethiopian\nlaw and because Ethiopia has an international commitment in this regard, the need to put\nin place the institutional framework goes without saying. In view of this requirement, the\nRevised Family Code under Art.321 (1) stipulates that the Federal Government shall,\nwithin six months from the coming into force of this Code, issue registration law\napplicable to the administration where this code is to be enforced and establish the\nnecessary institutions. Yet the Government has not taken any steps in this regard up to\nnow (February, 2008). Despite this, however, it is very much important to examine the relevant provisions of the\nlaw as regards proof of filiation. When we examine the provisions of the code, we can\nunderstand that there are two modes of proof of filiation. These are (a) record of birth (b)\npossession of status. Under the 1960 Civil Code there was a third mode of proof called\nact of notoriety as provided under Art.772 of the Civil Code of Ethiopia. This mode of\nproof has been removed from the RFC and regional family laws. Hence, our discussion\nwill focus on the two modes of proof. 7.5.2. Proof by Record of Birth and Possession of Status\nAs we said previously, the record of birth which appears as the primary means of proof of\nfiliation was not put into practice in Ethiopia. Article 3361 of the Civil Code suspended\nthe operation of the record of civil status in which birth was to be recorded. What was the\nposition of the possession of status as a means of proving filiation, in light of the\nsuspension of the record of birth? Possession of status was applied in default of the\nrecord of birth as was provided under Art.770 of the Civil Code.",

    "text": "Even today, although\nArt.154 of the RFC and the relevant provisions of the Regional Family laws provide that\nboth maternal as well as paternal filiation of a person are to be proved by his record of\nbirth and although the law has imposed the duty of coming up with the legal and\ninstitutional framework for the establishment of the office of civil status the government\nhas not yet come up with appropriate laws and institutions. However, it has been\nprovided by Art.332(2) of the RFC that until the Office of Civil Status is established,\ncertificates of birth, marriage and other relevant  certificates issued to issued by an\nappropriate authority of the administration where this code is applicable shall be deemed\nto have been issued by the office of Civil Status. The same is true with the regional\nfamily laws. For instance, Art.332(2) of the Amhara National Regional State Family Law\nprovides that “until the office of civil status is established and commence its work in\naccordance with sub-article one (sub-article one declares that the office of civil status\nshall be established within two years from the coming into force of the Code), certificates\nissued or to be issued by an appropriate authority of the region shall be deemed to have\nbeen issued by the office of civil status and considered valid (See also Art.338  of the\nOromiya Family Code). It must be clear to you that record of birth both under the Civil Code and the current\nfamily laws is the primary means of proof though not the only means. Despite this when\nit is not possible to prove filiaiton by record of birth, it is not possible to switch to proof\nby possession of status. In this regard, Art.155 of the RFC provides in default of\ncertificate of birth, filiation is proved by the possession of status of child. The question to be raised, therefore, is when can a person resort to proof by possession of\nstatus? Can an individual be allowed to prove filiation by possession of status by the\nmere fact that he/she does not produce the record of birth? No, this cannot be the case. Before one resorts to prove his case by possession of status, one should convince the\ncourt that birth certificate was not issued from the very out set or birth certificate was\nlost, destroyed or stolen. Therefore, the court must not admit proof by possession of\nstatus without convincing reasons that establish that proof by certificate of birth is\nimpossible.",

    "text": "Hence, proof by possession of status is allowed and it replaces proof by birth\ncertificate when the primary mode of proof is of no avail for one of the reasons\nmentioned above. What fact(s) should be proved by the witnesses? Art.156 of the RFC provides that a\nperson has the possession of status of child when the child is treated by the community as\nbeing the child of such man or woman. What does “as has been treated by the community\nas being the child of such a man or woman” mean? Of course, if certain members of a\ncommunity appear in court and testify that they have reasonable belief that the child\nbelongs to a certain man or woman, that may be taken as sufficient proof. However, such\nkind of testimony may not be sufficient because if the witnesses do not have enough\nknowledge as to their relation, they may believe that the relationship between a relative\nand a child may be a relationship of parent and child. However, in order to arrive at a just\nresult the witness should testify the identity of the mother and the father and the fact that\na certain child was born to those individual when the parents were in a conjugal life or in\nor irregular union or the child was born to these individuals even out of such unions. In one case (Nigisti Equbay V. Aster Yosef, Supreme Court Civil Appeal file\nNo.1716/1075, 1975), the appellant filed an application to the High Court so that the\ncourt would declare that Ato Yosef was the father of Aster. To prove the paternal\nfiliation, she produced witnesses and the witnesses testified that Aster’s mother and Ato\nYosef were living like husband and wife when Aster was born. Based on the testimony of\nthe witnesses the High Court decided that Ato Yoseph was the father of Aster. The\nSupreme Court to which the appeal was lodged also confirmed the decision of the high\nCourt. Art.157(1) of the RFC provides that where the possession of status of child is\nproved in accordance with the preceding article, the court shall take the presumption that\nthe child is born of such man or woman. This presumption is provided by the law for the\nbest interest of the child since the standard of proof is light. However, this presumption is\na rebuttable presumption as clearly provided under sub-article 2 of the same article. This\nmeans that the man or the woman who is presumed to be a father a mother can rebut the\npresumption by adducing any relevant and admissible contrary proof.",

    "text": "Some people strongly argue that possession of status as a means of proof (particularly for\npaternal filiation) must be admitted as means of proof when first of all filiation is\nestablished by presumption of law, acknowledgement or judicial declaration although\nthere are contrary arguments. Coming to the position taken by our courts, opinions are divided. In one case (cited by\nMehari Redae Vol.2 pp.73-74) the Federal Supreme court arrived at the following\nconclusion. The case pertained to proof of filiation of a certain child named Maria born in\nan irregular union. Accepting proof of filiation by possession of status the court stated as\nfollows:\nWe have had a look at the testimony of witness attached with the file. As we have\nunderstood from the testimony of witnesses that there was a long standing relationship\nbetween the mother of Maria and George (the claimed father of Maria) that George\noccasionally used to pass the night with Maria’s mother, that during this relation Maria\nwas born, that George declared that Maria was his daughter and he used to embrace her\nin a fatherly mood, that the name Maria was given to her by George and that he was\ndoing everything to Maria that could be done by any father up to the time of his death. Therefore, from the testimony of the witnesses we have understood not only that there\nwas along standing relationship between the mother of Maria and George but also the\nrelationship was a cause for the birth of Maria. From the testimony of witnesses and the\nactions taken by George, it is possible to presume that Maria was the daughter of George. If the testimony of witnesses enable us to presume like this, it is possible to maintain that\nthe appellant can prove filiation by possession of status. Accordingly, we have taken\npresumption that Maria is the daughter of George as provided under Art.157(1) of the\nRevised Family Code. Although the issue was similar to the above case, the Federal Supreme Court took a\ndifferent stance. The decision of the court was made on the basis of the provisions of the\n1960 Civil Code. However, since the RFC has not made any meaningful departure with\nregard to the issue under consideration, the case and the conclusion made by the court is\nrelevant to the issue at hand. The applicant, (mother) the mother of Fikrete kassahun filed an application to the court\nstating that Fikrete was born to Ato Kassahun Wube while they (the applicant and Ato\nKassahun) were living together in a non-marital relationship.",

He (Ato Kassahun) gave her grains which would serve for the\npreparation of “Kenfo” and ‘teff’ and barely that would be used for the preparation of\nfood and drinks that would be served when the daughter was baptized. She also added\nthat Ato kassahun was giving money for maintenance, clothing and education. Because\nAto Kassahun died on the 30th Sene 1982 E.C, she prayed to the court so that the court\nwould declare that Fikrete was the daughter of Ato Kassahun and a certificate be given to\nher to that effect. The legal wife of Ato Kassahun objected to the petition saying that Fikrete was not\nacknowledged by Ato Kassahun during his life time. She added that filiation is to be\nestablished by possession of status only when a child is born in an irregular union. The court to which the application was filed called the witnesses named by the applicant\nand the witnesses confirmed the allegations made by the applicant. The court, however,\nrejected the petition of the applicant by citing the pertinent provisions of the 1960 Civil\nCode. The case was taken by appeal to the Federal Supreme Court and the appellate court\nconfirmed the decision of the lower court. The court stated that:\n“The appellant (Fikrete’s mother) did not allege that Fikrete was born to Ato kassahun in\na marriage or irregular union, nor did she produce a document which shows that Ato\nKassahun acknowledged Fikrete; didn’t prove that Ato Kassahun was judicially declared\nto be the father of Fikrete because of rape or abduction of the mother by Ato Kasshun. The argument of the appellant is based on the fact that she produced witnesses who\ntestified that Ato Kassahun was the father of Fikrete Art.748(1) of (the civil code)\nprovides that an acknowledgement of paternity shall be of no effect unless it is made in\nwriting. Likewise sub-article 2 of this article clearly provides that acknowledgement\ncannot be proved by witnesses. Therefore, since the appellant in her claim that Fikrete is\nthe daughter of Ato kassahun did not produce any evidence supported by law. We have confirmed the decision of the lower court (see civil appeal No1768/88 Federal\nSupreme Court or Read Mehari Redae vol.2 pp.75-77). From the forging discussions and\nsamples of court decision you can realize that there is no consensus among our judges as\nregards the nature of proof of filiation by possession of status. 7.6.

    "text": "It is important because it is through the\nrules pertaining fililiation that both material filiation and paternal filiation can be\nestablished. The establishment of filiation is particularly important to protect the interest\nof children. That is why past and present Ethiopian family laws, have incorporated relevant\nprovisions which are instrumental for the establishment of filiation. The establishment of\nmaterial filiation is not as difficult as the establishment of paternal filiation. This is\nbecause maternal filiation is established by the mere fact of birth although birth is not\ndefined in Ethiopian law and it will remain a source of confusion particularly   in view of\nartificial insemination. As regards paternal filiation, there are three modes of establishment of paternity. These\nare legal presumption, judicial declaration and acknowledgment. In the case of legal\npresumption, once the existence of marriage or irregular union is proved, the law\npresumes that the husband of the woman or the man in a irregular union is presumed to\nbe the father of the child who is born or conceived in marriage or during the irregular\nunion. However, it must in mind be borne that such presumption is a reputable\npresumption. Coming to judicial declaration, (when it is possible to prove that what are\nprovided under Art. 143 of the RFC and the corresponding regional family laws), the\ncourt is duty bound to declare that a man is the father of the child under consideration. The third mode of establishment of filiation is acknowledgment. Acknowledgment is\ndependent upon the free will of the man. In other words, the man freely declares that he is\nthe father of a certain child so long as the stringent requirements of the law are fully\nsatisfied. As far as proof of filiation is concerned, the law has provided to modalities of proof. These are proof by record of birth and proof by possession of status. 7.7. Review Questions\n1. Why is it said that maternal filiation is the basis for consanguinal relationship? 2. A and B are a husband and a wife B has remained to be a good wife except that she has\nproblem of pregnancy since her womb is not able to carry fetus. Because of this, A\nand B agreed to transfer a fertilized egg from B’s womb to another lady called\nTihitina, who had the desire to remain virgin throughout her life. Despite her\nvirginity, the fertilized egg was transferred to the womb of Tihitina as per her\nagreement to carry the same. Then she became pregnant and a boy called Tariku was\nborn.",

However, Ato Jandereba’s sisters and brothers objected to the claim of the child\nalleging that the child was not the issue of Ato Jandereba. They adduced medical\nevidence as well as witnesses and proved to the satisfaction of the court that, Ato\nJandereba could not produce sperm and hence a child could not be begotten to him. Assuming that the case were brought to your bench, how would you go about the\ncase? 14. The following case was decided by the supreme court of Ethiopia in 1982 E.C under\nCivil appeal file No.1109/82. Although he was bound by a lawful marriage with his wife named W/ro Zenebetch\nLegesse, Ato Belayneh Abebe established an irregular union with Bahirework Tilahun. It\nwas in such union that Bahirework became pregnant. Because of this, Ato Belayneh\nconcluded marriage, although a bigamous one, with W/ro Bahirework on the 26th of\nHamle, 1978 E.C. However, Ato Belayneh Abebe died on the 27th of Nehasie 1978 E.C, a\nmonth after the celebration of the marriage. Then, after three months following the death\nof Ato Belayneh, W/ro Bahirework gave birth to female child named Messay.",

Introduction\nIn the normal course of circumstances, it is natural filiation which creates parent-child\nrelationships. However, exceptionally an artificial filiation is established by agreement\nbetween an adaptor and an adoptee for several reasons. Although adoption seems to be a\nprivate agreement between the adoptive parents and the adoptee, the involvement of the\nlaw is very much crucial in defining the manner of establishment of such artificial\nfamilial bond, the respective rights and obligations of the adopter and the adoptee, the\nessential effects of adoption and revocation of adoption when the need to do so arises. This chapter introduces students to the relevant provisions of the law regulating both in-\ncountry and inter-country adoption in Ethiopia. Hence, the chapter discusses, the meaning\nof adoption, the essential conditions of adoption, effects of adoptions and inter-country\nadoption. N.B. As usual, since it is the model for all regional family laws, reference will\nbe made to the provisions of the Revised Family Code (The RFC here in after) in order to\navoid unnecessary reproduction of legal provisions. 8.2. Objectives\nAfter completing this chapter, students will be able to:\n• define adoption;\n• discuss the essential conditions of adoption;\n• analyze effects of adoption i.e. both in-country and inter-country;\n• analyze the grounds which lead to revocation of adoption. 8.3. Adoption Defined\nAdoption is so widely recognized that it can be characterized as an almost world-wide\ninstitution with historical roots traceable into antiquity. The concept of adoption is\nunderstood differently in various culture. Despite that it is good to have a look at few\ndefinitions with a view to shedding light on the concept. For instance, Black’s Law\nDictionary defines adoption as: The creation of parent-child relationship by judicial order\nbetween two parties who usually are unrelated. (",

    "text": "Black’s Law Dictionary, 8th ed, 2004, p.\n52). Planiol defines the concept as: A solemn contract which creates relation between two\npersons analogous and those flowing from legitimate filiation (Planiol, p. 872). The Ethiopian Civil Code of 1960 defines adoption as a bond of filiation created\nartificially by a contract of adoption between the adopter and the adopted child (Art. 796(1) of the Civil). The RFC provides the same thing as the Civil Code. Under Ethiopian law, filiation is a grouping of persons based on blood relationship. Adoption is, therefore, acceptance of the rules of filiation in which such relationship is\ncreated artificially. In general, adoption is a way of home finding to children who have lost their natural\nparents by death, desertion, or their misconduct, and in a secondary degree for children\nwhose parents are unable or unwilling to maintain them. And it is the practice of\nabsorbing a child into a family that a child is not born into and giving it the legal rights\nand duties of a child that is naturally born to the adoptive parents. 8.4. Essential Conditions and Effects of Adoption\nAdoption in Ethiopia both in country and inter country is governed by international laws\nand conventions to which Ethiopia is a signatory and by its national laws particularly the\nRFC and regional family laws. Having based ourselves on these laws, we will discuss in\nthis chapter some of the legal requirements and effects of adoption. ( Read Arts.796-806\nof the 1960 Civil Code of 1960, the African charter on the Rights and welfare of the\nchild, OAU Doc. CAB/LEG/ 24.9/49/1990/ entered into force Nov. 29, 1999 and the\n1989 child convention. 8.4.1. Essential Conditions\nIn the past, Art 797(1) of the Civil Code provides that any persons of age may adopt a\nchild.” When it says “any person of age” it is referring back to Art 198 of the Civil Code\nwhich sets 18 years as age when a person is no more considered as a minor. In case of\nadoption also a person beyond the age of 18 years is capable of adopting a child unless\nsuch person is declared incapable by the law. Unlike the Civil Code, Art. 184 of the RFC\nprovides that “any person whose age is not less than twenty five years may adopt. Where\nan adoption is made by two spouses, it is sufficient that one of them be of full age of\ntwenty five years.",

    "text": "As regards the age of the adoptee, the RFC provides that any person\nwho is less than 18 years of age and under guardianship may be adopted. This means that\nonce a person has attained majority age, no purpose would be served by adopting that\nperson since is he/she able to maintain himself/herself. This is a clear departure the RFC\nhas made from the 1960 Civil Code since the latter did not say any thing concerning the\nage of the adoptee. The Code has no upper age limit because the purpose of adoption\ntraditionally is to have some one as heir. But one can argue that in case of adoption, it is\nthe best interest of the child which is given paramount importance. So if the adopter is\ntoo old it can’t provide the necessary care required for the child and this isn’t in the best\ninterest of the child. As to marital status of the adoptive parents, there is no provision which prohibits\nadoption by a single person. However, if the adopter is married the child is adopted by\nspouses jointly as per Art.180 of the RFC. But this doesn’t apply where a person adopts\nthe child of his spouse and one of the spouses is not in a position to manifest his/her will. Generally, however, adoption by two spouses is the best solution for the child, as he\nacquires the status of being each adopter’s own child and both are equally obligated to\ncare for him. It also avoids misunderstanding between the spouses on the future\nupbringing of the child. Moreover, adoption by a couple is preferred, simply by reason of\nthe likelihood that couples will provide a more “normal” family environment that could\nbe provided by a single adopter. If the above requirements are satisfied, the fact that the prospective adoptive parents may\nhave biological or adopted children of their own doesn’t affect adopting a child. Accordingly, Art 188 of the RFC states that, “the existence of children of the adopter\nshall not constitute an obstacle for adoption.” However, by way of exception sub-article\ntwo of this article states that although having children is not an obstacle to adoption the\ncourt must take into consideration the effects of existence of children of the adopter on\nthe well-being and interest of the adopted child. When you closely read the Ethiopian family laws, it is possible to understand that\nadoption is possible even if the natural parents are capable of rearing the child.",

    "text": "On the\nother hand, the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child permits adoption if the child\ncan’t be reared by his families or other alternative methods. The former can’t take into\naccount the capacity of natural parents to rear the child. While the latter takes into\naccount the capacity of natural parents to rear the child. Therefore, there is discrepancy\nbetween both laws. How can you reconcile the contradictions? The convention on the Rights of the child is\nan integral part of the Ethiopian law by virtue of Art.9 (4) of the FDRE Constitution since\nEthiopia has ratified it and the RFC was approved by the HPR. Hence, by taking into\nconsideration the principle of hierarchy of laws, should you give effect to the provisions\nof the child convention or the provisions of the Ethiopian Family Laws? It may be argued that granting adoption for every child reduces the chance of other\nchildren who have no other means to their care than adoption. This can be justified\npursuant to Art. 802(2) of the Ethiopia Civil Code for it says “If the child is under 15\nyears of age the contract of adoption shall be between the adopter and the guardian of the\nadopted child.” Therefore, in this case consent is given by the guardian. And when an\ninstitution of assistance or an individual seeks to act as guardian of the child, the civil\ncode requires a court appointment. When an institution is to act as guardian, the\nmanagement has to delegate one of it members to exercise such functions, courts are\ndirected to appoint relatives as guardians, when possible and to appoint institutions only\n“where necessary”. For the establishment of valid adoption, the consent of parents of the adopted child is\nmandatory. Accordingly, Art.190(1) of the RFC provides that both the father and the\nmother of the adopted child must give their consent to the adoption agreement where they\nare alive and known. Sub-article two of this article provides that where one of them is\ndead, absent, unknown or incapable to manifest his/her will, the other parent shall give\nhis consent. Despite the fact that the consent of both parents is necessary, one of the\nparents may not be willing to give his/her consent to the adoption. In this case, the court\nmay approve the adoption upon hearing the opinion of the other parent and of the child\nwhere the child is ten and above years of age. Sometimes, there may not be ascendants\nwho may give their consent to the adoption agreement.",

In some circumstances, government or private orphanages may give any child under their\ncustody to adopters. When this is the case, such orphanages are required to provide\nsufficient information to the government organ having authority to follow up the well-\nbeing of children, as to the identity of the child, how the orphanage received him and\nabout the personal, social and economic position of the adopter.

Despite what is provided under Art.193(1) of the RFC, the court may disregard the\nopinion of the authority and reject the agreement of adoption where the court thinks that\nthe agreement is not beneficial to the child. In other circumstances, where the court finds\nthat the information provided by the concerned authority is insufficient, it may order the\nauthority to conduct further investigation and submit additional information. The power\nof the court is also extended to ordering other individuals or organizations to provide any\nrelevant information in their possession or to give testimony (Read Art.193(3).

(Read Art.194 of the RFC). 8.4.2 Effects of Adoption\nWhen it is duly established, adoption produces certain legal effects. The conspicuous\neffects of adoption are marriage, succession, maintenance and the like. Let us see these\neffects briefly as follows. A. Marriage\nThere are certain conditions to be fulfilled before marriage is concluded. The Civil Code\nprovides that marriage between persons related by consanguinity and affinity is\nprohibited. In case of adoption bonds of consanguinity and affinity are created pursuant\nto Art. 556 of the Civil Code. Art. 8 of the Oromiya Family Code provides that adoption\nis one source of familial relationship. By the same taken, Art. 7 of the Tigray family code\nprovides that both consanguinal and affinal relationship can be established by adoption. Art. 181 of the RFC also provides that an adopted child shall, for all purposes, be deemed\nto be the child of the adopter. Therefore, relationship established by adoption may be an impediment to marriage in\naccordance with the degrees that are provided by the family laws of the respective\nregional family laws and the RFC. B. Succession\nBecause adoption establishes an artificial filiation, the provisions of the Civil Code\ndealing with succession both intestate and testate do apply to the adopted child. However,\nthere is no provision under our law which permits or prohibits an adopted child from\ninheriting his natural parents. But we can raise here two arguments. First the child is\nconsidered as a child naturally born into the family of the adoptive parents, he forfeits the\nright of inheriting his natural parents, for Art.836 says “adopted children shall be\nassimilated to the other children in case of succession.” The other argument is, as the\nadopted child shall retain his bonds with his family of origin, if so his right to inherit is\nnot in jeopardy as his relation isn’t dissolved.",

    "text": "However, there is no a provision in the\nCivil Code which prohibits the adopted child from inheriting his natural parents. With regard to the inheritance of the property of the adopted child, it is the family of\nadoption that is the ascendants, descendants and collaterals of the adoptive parents who\nhave the right to inherit. Since Art. 183(3) of the RFC states that, ‘wherever a choice has\nto be made between the family of adoption and the family of origin, the family of\nadoption shall prevail.” C. Rights and Obligations as to Support and Care\nAdoptive parents are duty-bound to support and care for the adopted child. Since the\nadopted child has an equal right as a naturally born child, it is also incorporated in both\nthe FDRE Constitution and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that the child is\nentitled to acquire care of his/her guardian. Hence, the mother and father are during their\nmarriage jointly guardians and tutors of their minor children. The guardians or tutors of a\nchild are duty bound to exercise different functions related to different needs as to\nresidence, health, education, social contacts and correspondence, and income, etc. of the\nchild. And the parents are responsible to maintain the child and give all the necessary\nmaterial support within their capacity. In return for support and care, a child who is capable, has reciprocal duty to give\nmaintenance to his adoptive parents. As expressly put under Art. 198 of the RFC an\nobligation to supply and maintenance exists between relatives by consanguinity or\naffinity in the direct line and between brothers and sisters. However, the adopted child,\nhis spouse and his descendants may not claim maintenance from the family of origin of\nthe adopted child unless the adoptive family isn’t in a position to supply such\nmaintenance. They aren’t also bound to supply maintenance to ascendants of the family\nof origin unless the latter can’t claim maintenance from another member of their family. With regard to obligation to supply maintenance to natural parents, there is no provision\nwhich obliges or prohibits. So it is at the discretion of the parties to supply maintenance\nor not. 8.5 Inter-country Adoptions and Safeguards to Children\n8.5.1 Inter-country Adoption in General\nThe shortage of adoptable children in developed countries, the unfortunate circumstances\nin which some children and parents in developing countries find themselves, along with\ngreatly increased international mobility, have given rise to the new phenomenon of inter-\ncountry (international) adoptions.",

( See Hery D.\nKrause, Family Law in a Nutshell, West Publishing Company 1995, pp. 208-209) and\nMary Ellision, The Deprived Child and Adoption, Pan Books Ltd, London, 1963, p. 105). In Ethiopia, the main cause for the start of inter-country adoption as an alternative care\nfor orphaned and abandoned children was the 1974/75 draught and famine that resulted in\norphaned and abandoned children. Because of this, the then Prime Minister’s office gave\ndirectives to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MOLSA) to consider and work\non inter-country adoption for orphaned and abandoned children in late 1970s. The\ndirective established a committee for facilitation of adoption, as well as it provides the\nprerequisites for selection of adoptive parents and documents required at that stage\n(Dinkalem Betru, The Concept of Adoption and Procedures Followed in Ethiopia,\nworkshop at Nazareth, July 1997, p. 5.) The term inter-country adoption refers to an adoption in which adopters and child don’t\nhave the same nationality, as well as one in which the habitual residence of adopters and\nchild is in different countries. Nowadays in Ethiopia, there are two kinds of inter-country\ncases. The first one is the biological mother voluntarily relinquishes her children for\npersonal reasons. It may also by both parents and guardians for reasons such as lack of\nmeans to support. We call these private inter-country adoptions. They are arranged\ndirectly between the biological parents and adoptive parents or their representatives or\nthrough an intermediary. The other is adoption of orphaned or abandoned children or\nchildren whose parents are ill and hence have no one else to act on their behalf. These are\ncalled agency inter-country adoptions for the reason that it is the agency which acts on\nbehalf of the child in case of adoption. Moreover, in the field of private international law, two aspects must be distinguished. One concerns the choice of law; the other the exercise of jurisdiction. The same two\naspects present themselves, once again, when the recognition of inter-country adoption is\nin issue. In civil law, adoption is regarded as a contract, albeit subject to approval by the\npublic authorities; the constitutive act of an adoption under this theory is the exercise by\nthe parties involves certain private rights.",

    "text": "If one adds it the contract theory of adoption a\nperson’s private rights regarding any point of his personal situation should be governed\nby a personal law, such as the law of his nationality. Then, it should follow that the right\nto adopt a child, or to be adopted, must be determined according to the national law of the\nperson in question. In other words, the contract theory tends to bring with it choice of law\nthat is for the validity of an adoption in which compliance with the national laws of at\nleast one of the parties is necessary. ( K. Kipstien, “Adoption in Private International\nLaw,” 12 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n, (1963) p. 836). In general, adoptions shall be granted only if it will be in the best interests of the child. And that the authority approving the adoption is to carry out a thorough inquiry relating\nto the parties through the agency or the appropriate authorities, and as for as possible with\nthe help of experienced social workers and agencies qualified in the field of inter-country\nadoptions. The making of the appropriate investigations preliminary to an adoption, is\ntherefore, left to the initiative of the forum state rather than to an internationally uniform\nprocedure, and this is each country’s courts are to apply forum law to all procedural\nmatters. Hence, it is with this in view that we will discuss some of the procedural matters\nsuch as selection of prospective adoptive parents, court proceeding etc., in relation to the\ntwo types of inter-country adoptions. 8.5.2 Placement of the Child\nUN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognized that “Inter-country adoption may\nbe considered as an alternative means of child care, if the child can’t in any suitable\nmanner be cared for in the child’s country of origin” (Convention on the Rights of the\nchild, (1989), Art. 21(c))). This principle also finds expression in a directive issued by the\nMinistry of Labour and Social Affairs in 1996. Art. 3 of the directive provides that: A\nchild can be adopted and expatriated only when it has been proven that it cannot get\nproper care in Ethiopia because foster parents or persons willing to adopt it could not be\nfound and that there is no other way it can be brought up properly here.”",

    "text": "Nonetheless, in certain circumstances inter-country adoption “may offer the advantage of\na permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family can’t be found in his/her state\nof origin.” This suggests that there are circumstances in which inter-country adoption\nmay be regarded as preferable for a child over institutional care in the country of origin. It is also obvious that the successful operation of this principle requires that the placing\nagency in Ethiopia should have the capacity to explore the alternatives to inter-country\nadoption. This implies a placement system which in some way is integrated into or at\nleast has ready access to information about the child-care services in Ethiopia. However,\nin inter-country private adoption, i.e., in the sense of not being arranged through an\napproved agency, insufficient attention may be given to the possible alternatives to inter-\ncountry adoption. That is why Art. 21(e) of the Convention in the Rights of the Child\nstates that the placement of a child in another country should be carried out by competent\nauthorities and must not result in financial gain for the parties involved. 8.5.3 Selection of Adoptive Parents\nIn the total evaluation of the interest of the child, the examination of the personal\nqualities of the adopter is of special significance. Each country has its own laws and\nprocedures regarding the selection and approval of prospective adoptive parents. In the\nUnited States, in order to be approved for adoption families go through a process called\nhome study. This entails contracting a licensed social worker to carry out the study by\nmeans of visits and phone calls. In Ethiopia, Art.193 of the RFC states that where the\nadopter is a foreigner, the court may not approve the adoption unless an authority\nempowered to follow the well-being of children, after collecting and analyzing relevant\ninformation about the personal, social and economic position of the adopter, gives its\nopinion that adoption is beneficial to the child. However, the court may reject the opinion\nof the authority and decline to approve the adoption where it (the court) thinks that\nadoption is not beneficial to the child. According to the afore-mentioned directive\nchildren are adopted and expatriated where it is verified that:\na. The would be adopter’s income will enable him to raise a child. b. The adopter is healthy, that his social life is not tainted, that he is of a sound mind\nand is not at all addicted to any dangerous drugs. c. The adopter has never been convicted of a crime or of being engaged in an illegal\nactivity; and\nd. The written consent of his lawful spouse has been obtained with regard to the\nadoption.",

    "text": "In general, it is necessary to arrive at a firm conclusion that the future adoptive parents\nwill be able to bring up the child properly and maintain him financially. Beyond that\nparents have responsibility to teach their children, respect and to provide with a\nconducive environment in which he may develop sound character. This responsibility\nimposes on a parent an obligation to train his child in differentiating “right” from\n“wrong” and develop his child’s conscience. It also requires a parent to teach by\nexample, that is, to conduct himself in a manner that his child may imitate. 8.6 Safeguards for Children in Inter-country Adoption\n8.6.1 Follow-up Work\nAs regards inter-country adoptions, the Convention on the Rights of the Child calls for\nthe guarantee of being informed of the child’s condition after authorization of adoption\nand his departure abroad. This enables the concerned authorities to ensure that the child’s\nrights are respected and that the child is faring well. To this end, the competent\nauthorities should follow-up the adopted and expatriated children. This can be done by\nrequesting concerned governmental as well as non governmental organizations found in\nthe child’s country of residence. Follow-up, among other things, is done by periodical\nvisits by experts from the competent authority and assess the situation of adopted\nchildren in the child’s country of residence. When it has been found out that the rights of\nthe adopted and expatriated child have been violated or that its welfare is not ensured, the\ncompetent authority shall take the necessary measures to remedy the situation. What do\nyou think are such measures? 8.6.2 The Child’s Right to Identity and Secrecy\nIn the adoption process three interests are involved i.e. the interest of the child, the\nparents i.e. both adoptive and natural, and public interest. The child has an interest to\nknow his identity. On the contrary, security is a guarantee based in part of a desire to\nprotect the parent from public embarrassment. The adoptive parents are guaranteed the\nsame anonymity as the biological parents. The adoptive family needs to be protected\nfrom intrusion in order that a healthy and stable relationship may be allowed to develop. Beyond this, the adoptive parent may feel his/her parenthood be threatened by disclosure\nand by the unknown results of any possible reunion. They can’t easily put distance\nbetween themselves as parents and their child’s personal need for identity. Furthermore,\nthe primary interest of the public is to preserve the integrity of the adoptive process.",

    "text": "That\nis, the continued existence of adoption as a humane solution to the serious social problem\nof children who are or may become unwanted, abused or neglected. Hence, the public has\na strong interest in preserving the confidential and non public nature of the process. Because of the difference in interest there is controversy. Nowadays, there are strong\nmovements in many countries to recognize the interest of the adopted child to discover\nhis true identity. Art. 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child seems to be a result\nof this it though identity is no defined in Art.8 or elsewhere in the convention. Instead\ninstances of identity are listed “nationality, name and family relations as recognized by\nlaw,” and, under Art. 8(1) the right of a child to preserve his/her identity “without\nunlawful interference” can be interpreted as placing a duty on states parties to allow\nadopted children the right to have access to records revealing the identify of their natural\nparents. Moreover, in the interest of children adopted, it must be revealed to them that\nthey have both biological and adoptive families. However, anonymous adoptions will\nusually prevent the adopted child from knowing when or whether an inheritance is due. On the contrary, some say that adoption records must be kept secret to protect parents and\nthe public at large. If adoption is made public, potential adopters may decline to adopt\nchildren which may have a negative effect on vulnerable children. Moreover, open\nadoption will encourage natural parents to become over dependent on adoptive parents,\naggravate adoptive parents’ sense of insecurity and confuse adopted children. To which\nof these arguments do you subscribe? Generally, however, any right to information must be balanced against the public interest\nin the adoption process which confidentiality is intended to protect. To this end, Art. 7 of\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child states that the child’s right to know its natural\nparents will have to be restricted by operative legal solutions, aimed at keeping the\nadoption secret. The afore-mentioned directive also recognizes that adoption to be treated\nas a strictly confidential matter, unless it has a negative effect on the welfare of the child. And also recognizes the child’s right to information about his/her country, natural parents\nand family member or in order to set free him/herself from any difficult condition that\nfaces.",

    "text": "Here we understand that the law demands that the secret of adoption be kept in\ncases where an adoption is revealed, damage to the parties involved can be great and lead\nto a severe family crises. At the same time, the child’s right to his identity is recognized\nparticularly with respect to granting access to information at some point in an adoptee’s\nlife whether at majority or earlier. Adopted children unlike natural children don’t share ancestry, genetic heritage, or family\nresemblance with their adoptive parents. They struggle with questions like ‘why was I\nplaced for adoption?”; “ To whom do I belong?”, “ who am I?”, “ who are my natural\nparents?” As they mature, they need acceptance, reassurance, and positive but realistic,\nresponses to their questions from their families and communities. They also need to\nunderstand that the decision made by their natural parents was based on their own\npersonal circumstances and not on the child’s being bad or damaged. This can be seen\nfrom these two cases. In the first one, a young man of 23 years old came to Ethiopia, where he was abandoned\nas a little child, to prepare his graduation thesis on the topic ‘Adoptions in Ethiopia.’ He\nwanted to learn about his natural parents. He was taken to Kechene Child Care Institution\nin Addis Ababa where he lived before he was adopted. He was told that his mother\nwouldn’t pay a visit to him as she abandoned him. Finally, he realized that he would not\nbe able to meet his natural parents. The other was a girl from Sweden who was abandoned as a little child in Ethiopia and\ncame back to learn about her natural parents along with her adoptive parents. She was\ntaken to Kechene Child Care Institution where she lived before she was adopted. She left\nfor Jimma which was traced to be the place where she was abandoned. In Jimma, she saw\nthe exact spot where she was found abandoned and realized the whereabouts of her\nnatural parents is unknown. And she was quite relieved thereafter for she learnt the truth. Hence, the longer an adoptive parent kept secret the fact of adoption from a child, the\nmore serious the consequences be when the fact is finally revealed. Similarly, the less\ninformation is revealed about the adoptee’s origins, the greater the problems for the\nadoptee.",

    "text": "Thus, generally parental motivation and commitment, the adoptive parent’s\nopenness in discussing adoption issues with their child, the age of the child at the time of\nplacement, and the child’s individual temperament have an influence on adoption\nadjustment. 8.6.3 Prevention of Unlawful Acts in Inter-country Adoption\nThe parent, guardian or foster parent may claim or accept money or other material goods,\nfor himself or somebody else, in exchange for a child’s adoption. A person may also\nobtain improper financial gain through acting as an intermediary or facilitator in a child\nadoption. But, in most states it is a crime to offer or receive money or any valuable\nconsideration for relinquishing or accepting a child for adoption since adoption is based\non the child’s need to have a family and not on the economic profit of intermediaries. Similarly, the afore-mentioned directive states those acts which are unlawful with regard\nto adoption of children. These are, accepting bribes to willfully give away of one’s child\nfor adoption, making adoption a business and profiting by it, and adopting a child against\nhis will or without the written consent of his parents. Moreover, under the guise of adoption, certain people engage in child abuse such as\nexploitation of children through pornography, prostitution, cheap labor, the removal and\nsale of organs used in transplants and other forms of abuse, some beyond even the wildest\nstretch of the imagination. To avoid this, Art.11 of the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild states that parties shall take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of\nchildren from abroad. And Art.35 of same convention calls for the counteraction of\nabduction, sale, or trafficking in children for any purpose or in any form. In addition, the\nHague Conference on Inter-country Adoptions calls for adoptions to be organized by\nauthorized adoption agencies. Therefore, although biological parents are often willing to\nmake private arrangements for adoptions, the government has to deter this by regulating\nand supervising adoptions to eliminate illegal trafficking in children. And hence strong\nadministrative screening and legal supervision to avoid intermediaries from making profit\nin inter-country adoption is needed. Do you think that Ethiopia has put in place the institutional and legal framework to\ncombat abuse of the right of the child using adoption as a cover? 8.7.

    "text": "The court,\nbefore giving the decision of approval, conducts serious investigations and inquires to\nmake sure that the agreement of adoption is in the best interest of the child in all respects. If an adoption is approved by the court, as a matter of rule, if is not revocable as clearly\nprovided in Art. 195(1) of the RFC. However, unlike Art. 806 of the Civil Code which\nprovided for the irrevocability of adoption for whatever reason, Art. 195(2) of the RFC\nstates that adoption may be revoked for the reasons mentioned there under. According to\nthis sub article, adoption may be revoked by the court where the adopter, instead of\nlooking after the adopted child, handles him as a slave, or in conditions resembling\nslavery, or makes him engage in immoral acts for his gain, or handles him in any other\nmanner that is detrimental to his future. The petition for revocation of adoption may be made by the child, a government organ\nauthorized to follow up the well-being of children or any other interested person (Art. 196(1)).When petition is submitted to the court the court shall determine whether the\ngrounds for petition are real and sufficient to warrant revocation. If the court is satisfied\nthat the petition is well founded, then it revokes the adoption. 8.8. Summary\nNormally, it is natural filiation which creates parent child relationship. However, artificial\nfiliation is established by agreement to be entered between the parties concerned. Such\nmode of establishment of familial relationship is called adoption which is entirely\ndependant upon the agreement of the adoptee (the child) and the adopter. In order to establish a valid adoption, essential conditions of adoption provided by law\nmust be satisfied. Once a valid adoption is established, it is only on few grounds that\nadoption is revoked. Even then, adoption is only to be revoked by the order of the court\nwhen it is satisfied that the continuance of adoption does not advance the best interest of\nthe child. A validly formed adoption produces certain legal effects. The first is, adoption becomes\nan impediment to marriage; secondly, it creates the obligation to supply maintenance and\nrights and duties of support and care between the adopter and the adoptee. Adoption could be in country or inter country. In the case of inter- country adoption, we\nhave to take care that the rights of children are respected and protected in accordance\nwith the requirements of Ethiopian laws and international human right instrument to\nwhich Ethiopia is a party. 8.9.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn our preceding, discussions you have learnt that family relationship may be established\nby consanguinity, affinity or adoption and one of the salient effects of familial\nrelationship is that an obligation to supply maintenance among and between such persons\nis created within the bounds of the law. One may be obliged to supply maintenance only\nto those persons the law has identified (to one’s ascendants, descendants, spouse or\nadoptee or adopter). The debtor in a maintenance obligation is obliged to supply to the\ncreditor those things necessary for the survival of the creditor provided that the creditor is\na needy one. Demanding maintenance allowance is not an absolute right. Rather there are\ncertain limitations. Even the one who is entitled to such an allowance may lose his right\nunder certain circumstances defined by law. This chapter is, therefore, aimed at introducing students to the law dealing with the\nobligation to supply maintenance. To this end, the chapter will concentrate on the\nrationale behind maintenance allowance, persons entitled to such allowance and persons\nobligated to supply, the subject matter of the allowance and termination of such debtor-\ncreditor relationship. 9.2. Objectives\nHaving completed this chapter, students should be able to:\n• define the subject matter of obligation to supply maintenance;\n• identify persons entitled to maintenance and persons obliged to supply\nmaintenance;\n• discuss the rationale behind such obligation;\n• state the reasons leading to extinction of the obligation;\n9.3. Rationale behind the Obligation\nAs you can understand, obligation is a legal relation, which consists in the duty of one\nperson (called the debtor) to perform or not to perform something towards another person\n(named the creditor). Obligation emanates from two sources-contractual obligations and\nlegal obligations. The former is an obligation created by the agreement of the creditor and\nthe debtor while legal obligations, however, emanate from the law itself. The obligation\nto supply maintenance is a typical example of legal obligation. Therefore, those persons\nidentified by law to discharge such an obligation are bound to meet their obligations even\nif they have not given their consent to do so. However, what is the rationale behind such obligation? They rationale behind such\nobligation is a moral duty that exists among family members. When a member of a\nfamily becomes needy, no one is nearer than the family members to maintain such\nmember. 9.4.",

    "text": "Subject Matter of the Obligation\nAccording to Art.197 of the RFC, the person who is obliged to supply maintenance is\nbound to supply to his creditor things that are necessary for the livelihood of the creditor. This means that the debtor is not bound to supply to the creditor things that would\nfacilitate luxurious life. The things that are necessary for the well-being of the creditor\nmust be given to him based on the social conditions and local custom of the area in which\nthe creditor lives. That is, the creditor who lives in the countryside may not claim to be\ngiven expensive clothes that are worn by fashion-conscious young people of big cities. Generally, things that are necessary for the livelihood of the creditor are; the means to\nfeed, lodge, and clothe, to care for his health and education, depending on conditions of\nthe creditor. Therefore, maintenance comprises everything indispensable for sustenance,\ndwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation depending upon the\nfinancial capacity of the debtor. The education of the person entitled to be supported may\ninclude his schooling or training for some profession, trade or vocation. 9.5. Persons between Whom the Obligation Exists\nAs provided in Art. 198 of the RFC, a person may be obliged to supply maintenance to\nhis spouse, ascendants, and descendants, his brothers and sisters. Although it is not\nexpressly provided in this article, a person is obliged to supply maintenance to his/her\nadoptee or adopter as the case may be. This is because Art.181 of the RFC clearly\nprovides that (without prejudice to Art.182 of the same code) an adopted child for all\npurposes, be deemed to be the child of the adopter. If an adopted child is for all purposes\nconsidered as the child of the adopter, it means that the adopter will be obliged to supply\nmaintenance to the adoptee and the adoptee will be obliged to discharge such obligation\nsince such obligation exists between a child and his ascendants and between a parent and\nhis descendants. These are the only persons that demand payment of maintenance from\nsomeone. The converse is also true. That is, someone can demand payment of\nmaintenance only from the above persons. Therefore, no person may be obliged to supply\nmaintenance to his uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces and other relatives. According to Art.201 of the RFC, the obligation to supply maintenance shall not exist\nunless the person who claims its fulfillment is in need and not in a state of earning his\nlivelihood by his work.",

    "text": "But the question is as to who is a person in need of maintenance\nand not in a state of earning his livelihood by his work? Generally, minors are in need of maintenance. Their parents are obliged to supply\nmaintenance to them. Moreover, persons who have no sufficient means to take care of\nthemselves as a result of poverty may be considered to be needy if they are unable to\nwork and earn an income. Aged persons and those who are seriously sick are considered\nto be not in a state of earning their livelihood by their work. If your brother, who has\ncompleted a secondary school, claims maintenance from you, you may reject his claim on\nthe ground that he is able to work, although he has no income. The obligation to supply maintenance shall, as a rule, be fulfilled by means of a\nmaintenance allowance paid by the debtor to the creditor for maintenance. The payment\ncould be in kind or in cash. The amount to be paid shall be determined by taking into\nconsideration the needs of the person claiming it and the means of the person liable to\npay maintenance (Art. 202 of the RFC). The ideal amount to be paid is the one that\ncorresponds to the need of the creditor and the paying capacity of the debtor. The amount\nfixed at one time may be revised at another by the application of the debtor or of the\ncreditor (Art. 203). This means, maintenance may be reduced or increased proportionally,\naccording to the reduction or increase of the necessities of the creditor and the resources\nor means of the debtor to furnish the same. As the maintenance allowance is believed to be extremely necessary for the survival of\nthe creditor, it cannot be attached nor can it be assigned. For example, such person may\nbe a debtor of another person. His creditor cannot attach the maintenance allowance. Also\nthe creditor of this person cannot ask the maintenance allowance be assigned to him. In\nthis regard there is a similarity between maintenance allowance and pension allowance. Assume that “A”, a son pays maintenance allowance to his father “B”. “ B” takes some\nmoney in loan from his friend “C” to drink alcohol. “ C” cannot ask “A” to assign the\nmaintenance allowance that is to be paid to “B”. Also “C” cannot attach the maintenance\nallowance of “B”. This rule has an exception.",

    "text": "In the above example, assume that “C” supplied to “B” things\nthat are necessary for the livelihood of “Y”. ( For instance he supplied “B” with food, or\ngave him medicine or gave money to pay house rent, etc.) In this case, “C” has the right\nto require the assignment or the attachment of the maintenance allowance that is going to\nbe paid to “B” for this is allowed as per Art . 205 of the RFC. All arrears, which have not been received or claimed within three months from their\nfalling due, shall cease to be due unless the creditor proves that such arrears were\nnecessary for his subsistence (Art 206 of the RFC). As per Art 207 of the RFC, in fulfilling his obligation of maintenance allowance, the\ndebtor may offer to discharge his obligation by taking the creditor for maintenance into\nhis/her house. Where there is a disagreement, the disagreement may be settled by the\ncourt. The court is expected to render appropriate decision taking into consideration all\nthe circumstances of the case. However, by virtue of Art.207 (3) of the RFC, the debtor\nmay not be compelled to take into his house the person entitled to claim maintenance. This was also incorporated in the 1960 civil Code (see Art 818(3). What do you think is\nthe rationale behind Art.207(3) of the RFC? Where several persons are liable to supply maintenance, the creditor may claim\nmaintenance from any one of such persons. Particularly, when all of the debtors have\nsimilar relationship with the creditor, the creditor may claim the payment of maintenance\nfrom anyone of such debtors (Art. 208) However, the debtor who has paid the allowance\nshall have recourse against those who have not paid their shares (Art. 209). That is when\nthe obligation to supply maintenance falls upon two or more persons, the payment of the\nsame shall be divided between them in proportion to the resources of each. However, in\ncase of urgent need and special circumstances, only one of them may furnish the support\nprovisionally, without prejudice to his right to claim from the other obligors the share due\nfrom them. You may have understood from Art 198 that between which persons the obligation to\nsupply maintenance exists. Although there is a reciprocal obligation to supply\nmaintenance between these persons, there is an order of precedence between them. For\ninstance, you are obliged to supply maintenance, first of all to your spouse.",

    "text": "In the second\nplace, you are obliged to supply maintenance to your descendants according to their\ndegree. Then your ascendants, according to their degree shall follow. ( See Art. 210). That\nis when two or more recipients at the same time claim maintenance from one and the\nsame person is legally obliged to give it, should the latter not have sufficient means to\nsatisfy all claims, the order established in Art 210 of the RFC shall apply. The debtors for maintenance may validly agree, as regards their reciprocal relations, that\nmaintenance shall be supplied to their common creditor by one of them. This agreement\nis beneficial to the creditor, because he can pursue only against one debtor instead of\nmany debtors to get his maintenance allowance paid. In such conditions, the creditor may\nnot make a claim against the other debtors to obtain maintenance unless he has a serious\nreason for not respecting such agreement (Art 211). The adopted child, his spouse and his descendants may claim maintenance from the\nfamily of origin of the adopted child when the adoptive family is not in a position to\nsupply such maintenance. It is said that adopted child has two families. The family that\nhas to take the prior obligation to supply maintenance is the adoptive family. It is only\nwhen the adoptive family is unable to supply maintenance that the family of origin is\nobliged to do so. Likewise, the adopted child shall not be bound to supply maintenance to\nthe ascendants of the family of origin unless the latter cannot claim maintenance from\nanother member of their family (Art. 212 of the RFC). The obligation of supply maintenance shall include the funeral expense of the creditor of\nthe maintenance. Therefore, the debtor of maintenance is obliged to cover the funeral\nexpenses of the creditor. For instance, if the neighbor of the creditor covers the funeral\nexpense of the creditor, the person who is obliged to supply maintenance for the deceased\nhas to pay back the funeral expense to the neighbor of the creditor (Art. 213 of the RFC). This rule shall also apply when the person obliged to supply maintenance to another\nrefuses or fails to give and when maintenance is urgently needed by the creditor, any\nthird person may furnish maintenance to the needy individual, with right of\nreimbursement from the person obliged to supply maintenance. 9.6. Termination of the Obligation\nIn our previous discussions, we have said that the obligation to supply maintenance is a\nlegal obligation. As such, it creates a debtor creditor relationship.",

    "text": "The one who is obliged\nto supply maintenance is the debtor while the one who entitled to receive maintenance is\na creditor. The source of such relationship is the law. Despite this legal bond, the debtor\ncreditor relationship cannot exist in perpetuity. It terminates on certain grounds. What do\nyou think could be the grounds of termination of such obligation? Although the Ethiopian Family laws have not fully incorporated the grounds of\ntermination, we can validly maintain that the following can be taken as the grounds of\ntermination of the obligation:\nA) Agreement of the parties:- The debtor and the creditor may agree to terminate such\nrelationship without affecting the mandatory provisions of the law. This is because under\nArt. 1975 of the Ethiopian Civil Code a contract is defined as an agreement whereby two\nor more persons as between themselves create, vary, or extinguish obligations of\nproprietary nature. Look at the following example: Ato A, a monk, was living in Addis\nAbaba. Because he was not able to maintain himself, his son, B, was ordered by the court\nto supply maintenance. After three years, the monk was resolved to pass the rest of his\nlife in Debrelibanose Monastery and agreed with his son not to claim any maintenance\nallowance from him. They also agreed that in case the monk abandon monastic life and\nreturn to Addis Ababa, the obligation of B would revive. From the above illustration, it is\nclear that the agreement of the parties has the effect of termination of the obligation. B) The ability of the creditor to earn his/her livelihood:- previously, we have said that\none is entitled to claim maintenance allowance when one is not able to earn his/her\nlivelihood by his her/own effort due to some reasons. But when it is possible to show that\nthe creditor is in a position to earn his livelihood or has acquired enough means to sustain\nhis/her life, there is no reason that makes the obligation continue. For instance, W/ro X was very much poor. As a result, she was receiving 300.00 Birr\nmaintenance allowance from her son-in-law as of 1990 E.C. Fortunately, she bought a\nticket sold by the National Lottery Administration and won 1,500,000.00 Birr. In this\ncase, because she became capable of maintaining herself, the debtor-creditor relationship\nexisting between her and her son-in-law terminates.",

    "text": "C) Inability of the debtor to discharge the obligation:- the relationship that exists\nbetween the debtor and the creditor does not suffice to entitle the creditor for\nmaintenance allowance. Rather the debtor must be able to provide maintenance. Hence,\nalthough debtor-creditor relationship has been established between the parties, such\nrelationship terminates when the debtor is unable to discharge his obligation for various\nreasons. For instance, Ato A, a farmer, was ordered by court to supply maintenance allowance to\nhis mother amounting 3 quintals of teff per annum. However, because there was a serious\ndrought in his locality, Ato A has never collected any crop for the last three years. He\nsustains his life and the lives of his children thanks to the food relief program. In this\ncase, the debtor creditor relationship between A and his father terminates since A is not\nable to supply maintenance. D) Condemnation of creditor (Art. 200 RFC):- The creditor loses his right of\nmaintenance where the commits or attempts to commit a criminal act against the debtor. The creditor may also lose his right of maintenance where he has committed or attempted\nto commit a criminal act on the life or property of the ascendants or descendants of the\ndebtor. The same is true or such crimes are committed or attempted on the life or\nproperty of the spouse of the debtor. 9.7. Summary\nOne of the conspicuous effects of familial relationship is that an obligation to supply\nmaintenance allowance among such persons is created within the bounds of the law. One\nis obliged to supply maintenance only to those persons whom the law has identified. The\nobligation to supply maintenance establishes a debtor creditor relationship provided that\nthe debtor is not able to maintain himself and the creditor is able to provide such\nmaintenance allowance. Generally, such obligation exists between ascendants and descendants, adopter and\nadoptee, spouses, and sisters and brothers. Such obligation is a moral duty existing\nbetween such persons. As to the subject matter of maintenance allowance, the law\nprovides that the debtor is duty bound to supply to the creditor things that are necessary\nfor the livelihood of the creditor. The obligation to supply maintenance allowance is not an everlasting obligation. It may\nbe terminated on a number of grounds. The grounds of termination are generally waiver\nof the right by the creditor, the ability of the creditor to earn his livelihood, inability of\nthe debtor to supply maintenance and condemnation of the creditor. 9.8.

Introduction\nIt is obvious that misunderstandings and disputes arise between spouses or partners in an\nirregular union. The disputes may be attributable to a number of factors. However, the\nmain thing is resolving such disputes using various dispute settlement mechanisms. These\nmechanisms are generally divided into two: settlement of disputes by courts and\nsettlement of disputes by out-of-court mechanisms which are collectively called ADR\n(Alternative Dispute Resolution) mechanisms. The RFC and Regional Family Codes\nhave incorporated these dispute resolution methods. Therefore, this unit is devoted to the\nstudy of dispute settlement mechanisms by concentrating on the relevant provision of the\nlaw. As usual, it is the provisions of the RFC that are to be cited under this chapter since\nthere are not points of departure made by regional family laws from the provisions of the\nRFC. 10.2. Objectives\nHaving completed this chapter, students will be able to:\n• identify dispute resolution mechanisms used to settle disputes arising  in\nmarriage and irregular union;\n• appreciate the role of regular courts in resolving family disputes;\n• define the status and significance of family arbitration;\n• discuss the departures that have been made by the new family laws with regard to\nthe power and functions of arbitrators from the 1960 Civil Code. • identify and analyze matters that need to be settled after the separation of the\nspouses. 10.3. Settlement of Disputes Arising out of Marriage and Irregular\nUnion\n10.3.1. Preliminaries\nAs you can understand from the foregoing chapters of this course, marriage is the base\nfor the existence of society. This may be the case only if there is a system which treats\nboth of the spouses and partners in an irregular union equally in stabilizing their union at\nthe time when there exists disagreement between them. It is impossible to avoid disputes\nfrom cropping up but it is possible to resolve them by utilizing different disputes\nsettlement mechanisms. There are a lot of causes for disputes that arise between a husband and a wife or between\na man and a woman living together in an irregular union. In order to resolve these\ndisputes between these persons effort is made by third parties.",

    "text": "These third parties may\ninclude courts, arbitrators, conciliators, mediators etc. Although courts are the ideal\ninstitutions to adjudicate family disputes in almost all countries, using the alternative\ndispute settlement mechanisms such as arbitration, conciliation or mediation is a common\npractice all over the world. In Ethiopian family laws, a solution is sought for disagreements between spouses or\npartners to an irregular union either by adjudication or by using arbitration. The law has\nput in place both the substantive and procedural provisions in order to help the disputants\nresolve their problems by regular courts or arbitration. These are clearly incorporated\nunder the RFC and Regional Family Laws. It is these two important dispute settlement\nmechanisms that will be discussed under this chapter of the course material. 10.3.2. Settlement of Disputes by Court\nIn any society, courts of law have been the proper institutions for settlement of disputes\nof various nature. Despite this, various ADR methods are as old as society itself for\nsettlement of disputes although such methods cannot absolutely oust the jurisdiction of\ncourts in setting family disputes. Although Art. 118 of the RFC provides that any dispute\narising out of marriage or irregular union is to be decided except for deciding divorce, by\narbitrators chosen by the spouses, if reconciliation becomes difficult to arbitrators or if\none of the parties or both of them feel that the way the arbitrators handle the arbitration\nprocess is wrong then they may appeal to a court having jurisdiction. After the appeal is\nmade to the court, the court will analyze the petition and may approve, amend or reverse\nthe decision of arbitrators and the decision of the court shall be final. This helps the parties to resolve their disputes amicably. In the case of marriage, even\nthough the spouses petitioned for divorce, the court does not immediately give decision to\ndivorce. As per Article 91 of RFC, when the spouses either conjointly or one of them\npetition for divorce, the court speaks to the spouses separately or jointly in order to make\nthem renounce their intention to separate for good and Article 82(1) of the RFC can be\nreferred for this. Where this effort is not successful, it will direct the parties to arbitrators\nto settle their disputes. A cooling period of up to three months is given to the disputants\nwhere they did not agree to settle their dispute through arbitration (Refer to article 82(3)).",

However, under the Civil Code, failing the agreement between the parties, the family\narbitrators would pronounce the divorce within one year from the petition for divorce\nhaving been made to them (see article 678(1) of the Civil Code). The departure of the\nRFC and regional family codes is that they have reduced the period from one year to\nthere months, if divorce related disputes are not decided by the courts within short time,\nthey will cause unnecessary suffering both to the parties themselves and to their children. The court is duty-bound to give an order regarding the matters to be settled after divorce,\ni.e., regarding maintenance of the spouses, the custody and maintenance of their children\nand the management of their property (Read Art. 81 and 82 of the RFC). According to Art 82(6) of the RFC,\nwhere circumstances absolutely require that one of the spouses leave their \ncommon abode, the court shall when giving an order under sub-article (5) \nof this article take into consideration the interest of children and the \ncondition of the spouse who may be affected more by leaving their \ncommon abode. In order to advance the best interest of children, Art 113 of the RFC gives direction to the\ncourts to treat the custody of children very carefully. Prior to the pronouncement of\ndivorce, it may encounter personal matters of the spouses that could not be displayed to\nthe public. Therefore, according to Article 110 of RFC, the court sits in camera while\nconsulting with the spouses either jointly or separately about these personal issues. By the same taken, according to Art.111 of the RFC, decision of the court should not\nincorporate the details of the case but only state the existence of sufficient causes for\ndivorce which is meant to maintain reputation of the spouses. Although courts are believed to be ideal institutions for settlement of disputes of families\nnature, they cannot be free from problems. Particularly in Ethiopia, a number of practical\nproblems are encountered by parties to a family dispute who take their cases to a court.",

One of the main duties of courts to is to consider cases relating to the custody of children. , 2nd ed, 1996, p. 44). (Read for instance, Robert Coulson, Family Mediation\nIf the parties are unable to come to agreement, the judges render the decision. A court\ntrial is full of controversies whereby lawyers do all the talking while the clients are\nwatching their private life on show. During litigation, the parties are to be cross-\nexamined by lawyers who ask them impolite and unpleasant personal questions. This is\nhumiliating for the parties because their marital privacy is being intruded in front of the\npublic (Ibid). Because of the fact that courts do not have time to listen to parties, they will not be well\nsuited to decide cases of child custody, visitation and financial support. Furthermore, the\nparties’ opinion has to be taken into account for insuring the children’s interest. Thus, the\nenforcement of an order, which does not reflect the wishes of the parties have bad\nconsequence on the upbringing of the children (Refer to David Foskett, The Law and\nPractice of Compromise\n, 1980, p. 150). Moreover, there is a large amount of cost incurred by the parties when they choose their\ncase to be treated in courts because they have to hire a lawyer and reimburse various\ncosts incurred by witnesses. The above limitations of courts would force the parties to resort to alternative dispute\nsettlement mechanisms. These alternative dispute resolution techniques incorporate the\nfundamental mechanisms by which disputes are resolved (Jan Macneil, American\nArbitration Law\n, 1992 p. 3). Coming to Ethiopia, it was believed that the RFC would avoid practice related problems\nin courts which were faced throughout the period in which the 1960 Civil Code remained\noperative. In spite of this, there are still problems in relation to the practice of courts\nwhile they entertain dispute of spouse or when they deal with post-divorce matters. The\nsituation may not be different in regional states since the family laws of the regional\nstates have not made any departure in relation to settlement of disputes arising out of\nmarriage or irregular union from the RFC. As it is discussed above, if the spouses petition the court for divorce, the RFC requires\nthe courts to discuss with the parties patiently and give the parties a cooling period in\norder to calm down their anger.",

Here you have to note\ntaking the dispute to arbitrators is not compulsory; rather it is voluntary. But according to\nsome sources what practically observed in courts is that the parties are not asked whether\nthey are willing to take their case to arbitrators or not rather the courts direct them to\narbitrators without doing what the law prescribes which is clearly against the spirit of the\nlaw. The 1960 Civil Code was amended in this regard with the idea that both pre divorce and\npost-divorce matters (maintenance, partition of property, custody of children) to be under\nthe control of courts. But there is a problem created practically, while courts transfer their\nresponsibility to regulate the partition of property of spouses, to arbitrators. The drafting committee believed that there would have to be a separate bench in order to\ncomplete the disputes so successfully by cooling the anger of the disputants and reconcile\nthem. Without this separate bench, it will be difficult to implement the law. But in\npractice, there is no so called separate bench to regulate family disputes. There are also additional problems that are reflected in the practice of courts. For\ninstance, the problem, which was believed to be resolved by Article 82(5) of the RFC, is\nstill without solution. According to this sub article, court shall give appropriate order\nregarding the maintenance of the spouses, the custody and maintenance of their children\nand the management of their property and it shall take into consideration the interest of\nchildren and the condition of the spouses who may be affected more by leaving their\ncommon abode. But after the file has been opened these matters take a considerable long\nperiod of time resulting in suffering of the parties particularly women. Among the issues that are to be regulated by courts, after the dissolution of the marriage\nby divorce or termination of irregular union is child custody. Article 681 of the 1960\nCivil Code states that children under the age of five years are to be entrusted to their\nmother unless there is a serious condition to do otherwise. However, according to Article\n113(1) of RFC, the court is expected to give an order as to which spouse shall have\ncustody of the children, care of their education, health, maintenance and the rights of the\nparents and the children to visit each other. Most of the time, it is observed that spouses\npray the court so that the decision would be in favor of one of them.",

    "text": "In such conditions,\npractically courts render decisions without giving reasons as to why the custody of a child\nis entrusted to the father or the mother. This is a problem, which is practically observed\nwhile the court is entraining child custody issues. In most of the decided cases it, is\nshown that courts do not take into account the requirements listed under article 113(2) of\nthe RFC (income, age, health and condition of living of the children) when deciding on\nchild custody. The other practical problem observed in courts when they are adjudicating\nchild custody issues is that, courts give decision only on the interests of the children. Even though the law demands the courts to consider the interests of the children, it does\nnot suffice to give a decision only based on that, there must be additional conditions that\nare to be taken into account by the courts (Wondwossen, Demissie, ¾}hhK¨<” ¾u?}cw\nIÓ Á}Ñvu` ‹Óa‹” u}SKŸ} ¾k[u Ø“© êOõ& Ide 22, 1998 E.C). The other issue is that of property liquidation decisions. Courts after pronouncing divorce\nclose the file and there is another file to be opened for the partition of property of the\nspouses because the court considers this case anew. As a result of this, the parties will be\nin difficulty as they waste their time, energy and money (Ibid). Even if the petition for partition of property is brought by the parties to the court after the\nvery moment of divorce pronouncement, still the case take a prolonged time to be\ncompleted. The grant of undue power to arbitrators is also another additional problem. (Ibid). 10.3.3. Settlement by Arbitration\nHistorically, the idea or concept of private dispute settlement mechanisms existed long\nbefore the creation of formal and organized judicial systems and codes of law. Ancient\nsocieties had the tradition of resolving disputes by using means very much related with\nmediation and arbitration since those disagreements between persons existed many\ncenturies ago. In our case, in certain part of Ethiopia, the persons with special qualities of personality\nand experience are those who are traditionally called shimagiles in order to save a\nmarriage from falling apart and preserve the integrity of the family. Spouses whose\nmarriage is in difficulty and as a result of this who seek for a divorce pronouncement,\nfirst present their case to a local judge who is traditionally known as “atbia dagna”.",

This was done through the process of reconciliation. If the judges fail to bring\nthe parties into an agreement they, will grant a divorce in cases of non-serious cause of\ndivorce. ( Aklilu W/Amanual, The Fallacies of Family Arbitration under the 1960 Civil\nCode, JEL, Vol. 9(1973) p. 194). This method of settlement of family disputes out of court was retained by the 1960 Civil\nCode of Ethiopia since the Civil Code incorporated provisions on arbitration. Although\ntraditionally, no one could be compelled to go to by arbitration, the 1960 Civil Code\nintroduced compulsory arbitration of spousal disputes. ( See Arts.722-731 of the Civil\nCode). Although family arbitration was criticized for not treating women in equal footing with\nmen, the RFC and the regional family laws have retained this alternative dispute\nresolution method. The 1960 Civil Code had incorporated arbitration primarily for the\npurpose of protecting marital privacy, to minimize divorce and to decrease court\ncongestion. But although the new family laws of Ethiopia have taken into consideration\nthese purposes they have significantly reduced the powers of the family arbitrators. ( Read\nTilahun Teshome, Ethiopia: “Reflections on the Revised Family Code of 2000” The\nInternational Survey of Family Law\n, May 2002, p. 7. Coming to the essence of arbitration, it is one of the traditional ways of avoiding disputes\nbetween conflicting parties irrespective of the causes of disputes. It is one of dispute\nsettling mechanisms most people choose because of its simplicity and since it brings a\nsolution to the conflict in the shortest possible time. It is preferable to ordinary court\nlitigation since it is not as expensive as litigation (Judith Areen, Cases and Materials on\nFamily Law, 3rd ed. 1992, p. 843). Arbitration is an out-of-court mechanism of settlement of disputes in which the parties\n(disputants) take their cases before a tribunal of their own choice. Besides, the parties\nhave the freedom to limit the power of arbitrators and regulate how the tribunal performs\nthroughout the process. This is the main distinction between regular courts and arbitration\ntribunals.

    "text": "Zekarias keneaa, “Formation of Arbitral Tribunals and Disqualification\nand Removal of Arbitrators under Ethiopian Law,” Journal of Ethiopia Law\n, Vol. 21,\nAugust 2007 pp. 138-172. In many countries including Ethiopia, arbitration has been widely used in both modern\nand traditional ways. And it is strongly believed that it plays great role in brining solution\nto disputes of all kinds, i.e. it could be disagreements created in commercial relations,\nbetween spouses, labor disputes, etc. Although there are arguments against arbitration, it is preferred to litigation in court\nbecause of its cost effectiveness, flexibility expediency and adaptability. What is arbitration? Although arbitration is one of the oldest mode of dispute settlement\nmechanisms, it has never been accorded a universally acceptable definition. Different\nindividuals define it differently although the difference is slight. Generally, to shed some light on the concept, let us take the following two definitions. Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term arbitration as:\n“A method of dispute resolution involving one or more neutral third \nparties who are usually agreed to by the disputing parties and whose \ndecision is binding. ( Bryan A. Gamer (editor-in-chief), Black’s Law \ndictionary, 8th ed., 2004, p. 112). From the above definitions, we can understand that the arbitral tribunal is constituted by\nthe agreement of the parties (where arbitration is voluntary) to a dispute and the decision\nhanded down by a neutral third party is binding upon the parties as though it were given\nby a court of law. According to Rene David, arbitration is defined as:\n“Arbitration is a device whereby the settlement of a question, which is of \ninterest for two or more persons, is entrusted to one or more other \npersons-the arbitrator or arbitrators- who derive their powers from \nprivate agreement, not from the authorities of a state, and who are to \nproceed and decide the case on the basis of such agreement.” ( Rene \nDavid, Arbitration in International Trade, Kluwer Law and Taxation \nPublishers, Deventor, Netherlands, 1985, p. 5)\nThis definition also tells us that arbitration is a dispute settlement mechanism and the\npower of the arbitrators does not emanate from the authorities of the state but from the\nagreement of the parties. How do you evaluate the institution of family arbitration in Ethiopia in the light of the\nabove definitions? Even though, the institution of family arbitrators is retained in the RFC, as it has its\npowers are so much reduced.",

    "text": "Except for reconciliation of the spouses, all other powers of\narbitrators which were incorporated the under the Civil Code, are given to the court. Hence, the institution of arbitration retained in the family laws does not fulfill the\ndistinguishing features of arbitration. Despite this, arbitrators play significant roles in\nresolving of disputes of spouses and especially in the countryside. This is because people\nliving in countryside know each other very well and the arbitrators are selected among\nfriends, village elders and religious leaders. And it is for them to find out the actual cause\nof the dispute of spouses and seek for a solution. In the RFC, and other regional family laws, arbitration could only serve as an alternative\nmechanism of dispute settlement and the reason for this is that if arbitration outs regular\ncourts for matters of family disputes then the rights of women would be at stake. This is\nbecause arbitrators, it is believed, in Ethiopia may not be qualified enough to resolve all\nfamily disputes including pronouncement of divorce. There is an international concern about the pronouncement of divorce to be under the\npower of competent court. Many pressure groups, NGO’s, etc strongly believe that the\npronouncement of divorce by a competent court is worthwhile. Among the international\ninstruments that requires only competent judicial authorities grant divorce is the UN\nEconomic and Social Council, in its Resolution 1068 G (XXXIX) o 16th of July 1965. This has influenced the law makers of many countries including Ethiopia Since it is\nThe basis for the argument here is that, such tribunals usurp court \npowers. When an organ other than the court makes decisions that would\nseriously affect the lives of people, there is a danger that justice could not \nbe served well. At this juncture, we have to ask question such as: How are arbitrators appointed. What\nare the responsibilities of arbitrators? What are the limitations of family arbitration and\nwhat problems are associated with family arbitration (Read Zekarias Kenea, Formation of\nArbitral Tribunals and Disqualification and Removal of Arbitrators under Ethiopian Law,\nJournal of Ethiopia law Vol. XXI, 2007, pp. 138-176)\nAs regards appointment, Art. 119 of the RFC confers the power upon the disputants to\nappoint the arbitrators and the number of the arbitrators is not limited under this same\narticle. What it simply puts is that their number can be one or more than that. Although\nthe arbitrators are appointed by the parties, arbitrators are under the control of the court.",

As it is clearly stated under Article 121(1) the same code, sole duty of the arbitrators is to\nmake an exhaustive effort to reconcile the spouses.

Settlement of Other Family Disputes\n10.4.1. Preliminary\nThere are two possible outcomes from the processes of dispute settlement be it by courts\nor by alternative dispute settlement mechanisms, i.e., either the spouses be brought to\nreconciliation or their contention end up in divorce. In cases where the spouses separate\nfor good, it does not mean that they have absolute freedom to build up a new life of their\nown. This is because dispute settlement of the spouses goes further than this (even after\ndivorce). Thus the divorced man and woman are expected to act according to the\nprescription of the law which is concerned with the post- divorce matters that need to be\nsettled. According to the law, the court has to give its decisions on three very important post-\ndivorce issues; namely, child custody, maintenance allowance for the child and visitation\nrights of the child by the non-custodial parent. These matters will be discussed under the\nfollowing sub-sections. 10.4.2 Child Custody\nThe choice of determining the custody of a child lies either on the parents themselves or\non the court. In general terms, the word custody pertains to whom the child is to live\nwith, and which parent has the responsibility to make major decisions about the life of the\nchild. In some cases, parents may be given right of joint custody which is the case when\nthe child lives with both parents at different times. Sometimes while one parent acquires\ncustodial right, the other parent would be allowed by the law to exercise the visitation\nright. There are times when the law determines how often the non-custodial parent is\nallowed to visit his/her child (Kenneth Fox, Every Thing you Need to Know about your\nLegal Rights, 1995, p. 21). Child custody may be understood as the right to retain a child at one’s home which at the\nsame time empowers the parent to control the child.",

    "text": "Custody originated from the\ncommon law and the word custody used by this author is in relation to children which is\ndefined as “…A state of fact; in this sense a child is in the custody of an adult if he\nhappens to be under the adults’ physical control or in the wider sense of a ‘bundle of\npower’ including not only the power of physical control but also powers relating to\nchild’s education, religion, property and the general management of his life which is\nalmost the equivalent of guardianship (Fasil Taddesse, Arbitration and Resolution Urban\nand Rural perspective in Ethiopia, the practice of Family arbitration in selected four\nWoredas in Addis Ababa, December, 1998). The law governing child custody has its own origin. Previously, where there was absolute\nmale dominance in every aspect in the society, men were believed to be endowed with a\nright to acquire everything. Likewise, where traditional male authority over the family\nwas of prevalence, the custody of children was given to fathers only. This absolute right\nof the father was extended even after his death. Without taking the mothers (who is alive)\nright into consideration, he could appoint testamentary guardian for his children. But this\npaternal dominance which would affect right of mothers over their children has been\ngradually replaced by a concept which is much better than the previous one. Women’s\nright to custody of their children was recognized because they were believed to be the\nbest possible individuals for the proper upbringing and nurture of their children. As the\nresult, primacy of paternal custody rights has been undermined (Ibid). This evolution of the law regarding child custody is to some extent reflected in provisions\nof the 1960 Civil Code of Ethiopia. As per Article 618 of the Civil Code, the governing\nprinciple regarding custody of children above the age of five was the best interest of the\nchild and this makes it “sex neutral”. But this evolution of the law concerning child\ncustody issues which has been upgraded from “the primacy of paternal custody” to the\n“best interest” standard enhanced judicial authority over child custody issues. This\ndoctrine was criticized because it created implementation problems by the judges. The\n“best-interest” standard was very wide and an indeterminate as it embraces so many\nthings to be taken into account by the judges in order to grant a decision on child custody\nissues. Thus, this resulted in unlimited judicial authority.",

    "text": "The movement from paternal\ncustody to the application of best interest of the child doctrine, is movement from\n“paternal patriarchy to judicial patriarchy” which shifted child custody issues from the\nunlimited paternal authority to unlimited judicial authority” (Fasil Taddesse p. 34). U.S courts were also faced with the same kind of problem in connection with the “best\ninterest” standard. The solution that was sought was known as ‘tender years rule”, which\ndeclared that infant children below puberty, and youngsters affected with serious ailments\nshould be placed in a mother’s care unless she was proven unworthy of the responsibility. As per the 1860 New Jersey Code, “the mother is entitled to the custody of her children\nunder the age of seven unless it affirmatively appears that, in her custody, they should be\nexposed to either neglect, cruelty or the acquisition of immoral habits and principles.” (Id, p. 41). This kind of “maternal preference” rule was also reflected under article 681(2) of the\n1960 Civil Code. Coming to the RFC, as it is incorporated under Article 113(1) of the\nRFC, the court, after pronouncing the dissolution of the marriage, has to deal with three\nimportant matters: child custody, maintenance allowance for the child and visitation right\nof the child and the non custodian parent. As per Article 113(2) of the RFC, since the\ncourt has to take into consideration the income, age, health, and condition of living of the\nspouses as well as the age and interests of the children, it is felt unnecessary to retain the\nprovision of the 1960 Civil Code (Art.681(2)), which entrusts children below the age of\nfive to their mother. The RFC tries to state elements that the court has to take into consideration rather than\napplying the ‘best interest’ standard or the outdated ‘maternal preference’ rule. The\napproach of the RFC in this regard is in line with the current trend followed by other\njurisdictions for determining child custody issues. Thus, for this purpose, the RFC,\nillustrates guidelines based on which the court may pass its decision regarding child\ncustody, maintenance allowance for the child and visitation rights of the child and the\nnon-custodian parent. The court is required to take several factors such as, the income,\nage, health and condition of living of the spouses as well as the age and interests of the\nchildren into consideration.",

    "text": "The aim of Article 113(2) of the RFC, is to avoid material preference to child custody\nwithout a justified reason. Therefore, RFC regarding child custody is designed in such a\nway as to deal with such issues from different angles since it demands great care while\nthe court is to decide on the fate of the children who are the future generations of the\ncountry. However, there are some implementation problems. To begin with, the final judgment of\nthe courts as to whom the child belongs to, does not contain satisfactory reasons. There\nare situations whereby the judgment of the court is made arbitrarily when it chooses the\nfather or the mother to be better custodian of the child. Courts, most of the time, do not\nequally consider all the factors that are listed down under Article 113(2) of the RFC. The\ncourt grants judgment solely relying on the preference of the child. The court has to\nclearly identify whether the child’s preference was some how influenced by parental\npressure or not and whether there are other factors that have strong effect directly or\nindirectly on the preference of the child. ( ¨”É¨c” ÅUc?& ¾}hhK¨< ¾u?}cw QÓ ¾›}Ñvu`\n‹Óa‹” u}SKŸ} ¾k[u Ø“© êOõ& Ide 22 k” 1998 ¯.U Ñê 43). The reliance of the courts on the child’s preference has also created problem in\ndestroying the best interest of the child standard that is enshrined under Article 113(2) of\nthe RFC. Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the child gives a paramount\nconcern for the best interest of the child when it states:\nIn all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or \nprivate social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities \nor legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary \nconsideration. Despite the problems reflected in the practice of the courts when they entertain child\ncustody issues, Article 113 of the RFC is one step ahead that helps for the protection of\nchildren’s right and which tries to incorporate the current trend concerning determination\nof child custody by the courts of other jurisdictions. 10.4.3 Maintenance Allowance\nAccording to Black’s Law Dictionary (6thed, 1993 p. 953)\n…maintenance is sustenance support assistance and the furnishing by one \nperson to another, for his or her support of the means of living, or food, \nclothing, shelter, etc, particularly where the legal relation of the parties is \nsuch that one is bound to support the other, as between father and child or \nhusband and wife, the supplying of the necessity of life.",

    "text": "While the term \nsimilarly means food, clothing and shelter, it has also been held to include \nsuch items as reasonable and necessary transportation or automobile \nexpenses, medical and drug expenses, and household expenses… \n \nAs has been clearly incorporated in Article 113 of RFC, maintenance of children is one\namong the issues that the court shall see after deciding the dissolution of marriage. Referring to Article 198 of the RFC, the person who is able to shoulder the responsibility\nof maintenance is obliged to supply maintenance only to his proximate relatives by\nconsanguinity and affinity, and to his spouse. Thus, what we infer from this same\nprovision is that there is a boundary beyond which the obligation of a person to supply\nmaintenance may not be extended. The kind of bond that both the person who is obliged\nto supply maintenance and who is demanding it, is debtor-creditor relationship where the\none that pays maintenance is the debtor and the person who receives the payment of\nmaintenance is the creditor. But at the same time, the RFC has laid down requirements\nfor the existence of this kind of obligation, i.e., in order to be supplied with maintenance,\nthe person who is demanding it (creditor) has to be in need of it and he has to be not in a\nstate of earning his livelihood by his work (Read Mellese Damte, Cases and Materials on\nthe Ethiopian Family Law, May 2004, p. 234). With no doubt, minors are in need of maintenance because they are dependant on their\nparents to sustain their lives and at the same time they are not expected or are unable to\nearn their livelihood by their work. But there are circumstances whereby children may\nearn income by their labor since under the Ethiopian labor Proclamation, which is in line\nwithinternational standards children of 14 years of age and above are allowed to be\nemployed. Moreover, aged persons and those who are seriously sick are categorized to\nthose kinds of persons who are unable to earn an income by working. These persons due\nto the condition they are in, they are unfit or incapable to earn their own income in order\nto fulfill their basic needs. As per article 197 of the RFC, the obligation of the person who is ready to supply\nmaintenance is limited only to things that are necessary for the livelihood of the creditor. Moreover, the same article stipulates that the supply of maintenance be in decent manner\nhaving regard to social conditions and local custom of the area in which the creditor lives.",

    "text": "In some jurisdictions, such rights of the creditor would extend even after he/she has\nattained his/her majority age and he is able to work and earn his income although this\nkind of rule is absent in our Revised Family Code and the regional family laws. Having regard to the provisions of RFC dealing with “obligation to supply maintenance”\nlet us resort to Article 113 of the RFC which requires courts which decided the\ndissolution of marriage at the same time to render its decision on matters of custody of\nthe children, care of their education, health, maintenance and the rights of the parents and\nthe children to visit each other. It also provides that after the court decides upon to which\nspouse the custody of the children belongs, care of their education, health, maintenance\nand visitation right, the court should consider the income, age, health, and condition of\nliving of the spouse who is able to assume duties that are lied down under article 113(1)\nof the RFC. As far as the maintenance of the children is concerned, once the marriage bond is\ndissolved by divorce of the spouses, the obligation to supply maintenance to the wife\nceases and the execution proceedings taken after the divorce judgment would\nconsequently have to be for maintenance of the children only. According to Article 202\nof the RFC, the spouse (debtor) against whom the court passes its decision to maintain\nthe children may fulfill the obligation to supply maintenance in kind or in cash. But this\nshould fundamentally be based on both the needs of the person claiming it and the means\nof the person liable to pay maintenance. A child whose parents are separated due to none of his fault should not be subjected to\nsuffering. Even if there is nothing better than living with his both parents happily but if\nthing turn out to the contrary and conditions makes him live only with one of his parents,\nhe has to at least be maintained properly by the non-custodial parent. When the court is ready to decide on the payment of maintenance for the child it must\ntake into account factors like for how long and how much does the non-custodial parent\npays the maintenance to his child. Most of the time, the non-custodial parent is compelled\nto pay maintenance until his/her child attains majority age (18 years of age). But the\nparents may reach an agreement as to the additional time of payment of maintenance.",

    "text": "As\nto the amount of the maintenance to be paid, the court will take into account the earning\nof both parents and the living condition of the family. But this does not help much\nbecause after knowing how much the non-custodial parent earns, deciding how much\nhe/she has to pay is something difficult to deal with. The other problem revolves around when the parties plan to effect the payment of\nmaintenance by their own (out of court) agreement or by involving third party. Putting\nthe money into bank account of the person who is to be paid maintenance is also another\noption that the parties willing to take. Making payment by coming to the court every\nmonth and telling the employer of the non-custodial parent to deduct from his salary the\namount of maintenance money are also other ways of enforcing payment of maintenance. 10.4.4. Visitation Right\nVisitation right is a right granted to non custodial parent. This means in other words that,\nthe other parent to whom the custody right of a child is given must permit the other non-\ncustodial parent to visit the child. Moreover, it is usually put in the decision of the court\nthe manner and how often the non-custodian parent visits his child. However, the\nvisitation right should not go against the best interests of the child. Thus, courts put\nseveral restrictions on this right like frequency, length and location of visitation and\nwhether someone else or third party besides the non-custodial patent must be present. Therefore, generally speaking, physical custody of the parent who is awarded sole legal\ncustody is shared through visitation right. There are certain conditions under which\nvisitation right is denied or restricted. This is when visitation right would affect the child\nadversely (Harry D. Krause, Family Law, 1988, p. 196). Some jurisdictions hold the position of denying the visitation right of the non custodial\nparent if it “endangers seriously the child’s physical, mental, moral or emotional health.” Other statutes give the court power to deny visitation rights simply if visitation is deemed\nnot to be in the best interest of the child (Ibid). The basic dilemma is that while the grant of meaningful visitation rights to the non-\ncustodial parent softens the impact of a custody decision and helps preserve for child and\nparent a continuing social relationship, coerced visitation, when parents ‘hate’ each other\nmay prolong the child’s trauma.",

    "text": "There are times when visitation right is so much abused\nby the non-custodial parent so that the latter would keep intouch with the former spouse\nof his/her and with the child (Ibid). Due to this problem, some argue that forced visitation must be abolished. But, this point\nof view would go against the natural right of the child to know both of his parents. ( Harry\nD.Krause, Family Law in a Nutsell, 3rded., 1995, p. 319). How do you explain this\nproblem in light of the Ethiopian situation? According to Art. 113(2) of RFC, when the court provides its decision as to who would\nbe the custodial parent of the child and other related matters like maintenance payment,\nand visitation right of the non- custodial parent, it has to take into account the income,\nage, health, and condition of living of the spouses as well as the age and interest of the\nchildren. But there are cases where by the court simply awards the child custody right and\nvisitation right to either of the parents based on the mere joint agreement of the parents. This would go in contrary to what Article 113(2) puts as “the age and interests of the\nchildren.” 10.5. Summary\nIt is not arguable that disputes of various nature and magnitude arise between spouses or\npartners in an irregular union. But, such disputes must be resolved in one way or another\nin order to protect the family as a whole and to protect the interests of children in\nparticular. Family disputes arising in marriage or irregular union may be resolved by courts or ADR\nmethods such as arbitration, conciliation, mediation and the like. It is obvious that in any society, courts of law are the ideal institutions for settlement of\ndisputes- be it family, commercial or labor disputes. However, various ADR methods are\nalso as old as society itself for settlement of disputes although the latter cannot absolutely\noust the jurisdiction of courts. The Ethiopian family laws have also given recognition to settlement of family disputes\nby courts and ADR mechanisms although the roles to be played by courts are quite\ndifferent from the roles to be played by ADR mechanisms. 10.6. Review Questions\n1. Arbitration is basically characterized by involving one or more neutral third\nparties who are usually appointed by the parties to a dispute and whose decision is\nas binding as a court decision although such decision may be subject to judicial\nreview on certain clearly defined grounds.",

Is the formula adopted by the RFC and regional family laws in resolving family\ndisputes by arbitration better than that adopted by that of 1960 Civil Code? Why/Why not? 3. Why do you think the role of so-called arbitrators is significantly reduced under\nthe RFC as compared to the 1960 Civil Code? Do you think that the reduction of\nthe powers of family arbitrators plays roles in safeguarding the rights of women\nand children? 4. Should family arbitration proceedings be open to the public or closed? Why/why\nnot? 5. Under what circumstances should the court sit in camera (in a closed session)\nwhen it entertains family disputes? 6. The Ethiopian family laws seem to confine themselves to settlement of disputes\nby arbitration and court. However, wouldn’t it be appropriate to incorporate other\nADR forums such mediation, conciliation and the like in the laws in view of the\nfact that court congestion/backlog of cases is an actuate problem in Ethiopia? 7. Particularly an ethnic-based federalism is established, among other things, to\nentertain diversities. However, major family law codes (Amhara, Tigray, Oromiya\nand SNNP) have adopted the same family dispute resolution mechanisms as that\nof the RFC. Do you think that is proper? In other words, wouldn’t it be better if\nregions were to have embraced other dispute settlement mechanisms that would\nfit into their social, political and economic realities? Discuss. 8. What would the consequence(s) be if divorce were to be pronounced by\narbitrators? 9. As you know, the requirements for the formation of irregular union are not so\nastringent as marriage. As regards, termination, either of the parties can put an\nend to such union for no apparent reason. If that is the case, why do we talk about\nsettlement of disputes arising out of irregular union? Discuss. 10. Field Work\nForm a group consisting of 4 or 5 students, go to courts and collect decided cases\nin relation to settlement of disputes arising out of marriage and irregular union. Then, by critically studying the cases, evaluate:\n10.1. whether the courts are settling disputes in line with the spirit of the law. 10.2. the efficacy of the new family laws in resolution of family disputes.",
